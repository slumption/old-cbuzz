<B>6th June 1996</B><P>

Yes, The Brighton International Festival is over, HOORAH!  So how many of you went to any of the ponced up events?<p>

Me, I personally went to an uncountable number of lunchtime chamber orchestra recitals, honest!<p>

I then took my arse in my hand and saw 'Peter Sellers in conversation' starring the director of 'The Electrification of the Soviet Union' - Hmmm, know it well!<p>

Next up, I parted with ï¿½18 to see 'cosi fan tutte' by mistake, I miss read it as 'cosi tight fanny'!<p>

Oh well, what with orchestral concerts at the dome, comedies about Soviet society, concerts from Leipzig string quartet and even the Israel piano trio! The Dubliners and Poppy (In a shameless anachronism lyrics and melodies are discovered by a voice and a few guitars - Sounds like the eurovision songcontest winner - Poppy live is a bright, loud and sometimes ironical experience - You'll love it!!! - Piss off).

<p>

My diary was as full as a lift with Biggie, Roseanne Barr, Big Daddy and the entire Wu-Tang Clan inside it - not!<p>

Fuck international festival - lets have something that local people would like and afford to go to.

<p>

Even in the back of the program there is a map and information for people who don't come from Brighton with special notice taken to list routes from London.  All it adds up to is stuck up nobbos and poncey pratts coming down from their swankt Chelsea homes using Brighton as some Fucking Vaudeville stage, they probably still think they're gonna see bathing on the beach!<p>

We ought to force feed them seaweed, seawater and old shells like they used to do in the Victorian days only not for medicinal purposes.<p>

About the only good thing is the fireworks and some shamrock worshipper got them called off.  And now they've been cancelled 'cos of the weather, they'll probably not bother 'cos no one will want to see them, well not any one from London!!<p>

I think the last page of the brochure sums it up with an advert for 'no-ones listening' Radio 3 and seeing on the front that it is sponsored by Pinnocchio and Dontello Ristoranti (!) We all know to go elsewhere to get our pizza and pasta dishes Hah!!<p>

No one need to frett though, we have got the Adur festival '96 to look forward to, "Be there or get flanned" we are informed by their ad.  'Be there or be forced to listen to their Radio station' is a heavier threat - I've heard it's run by the same people who do the Brighton one! (Big up the original Festival radio and all those who know - Not these pretend TOYS).<p>

So all in all Bollocks to the lot!<p>

O.K. I'm out D.C.<p>

p.s. Good Cybar party, liked the food and the free goes on the Internet - Peace to cBuzz.<p>

p.p.s. Why is there so many little turn coats who once slagged off David Cunningham (head of newave broadcasting, the makers of Brighton Festering F.M) and said they would never work for him, now licking his greasy butt?<p>

Could it be they think Davey boy will get the full time license?<p>

But surely if he does get it, the fact that Newave is supported by the evening Argus makes the unholy alliance a media monoply, think about it and an meanwhile E mail'em via - newwave@pavillion.co.uk and tell them were to sick it and how far to go!!<P>
