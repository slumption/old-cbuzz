<font size=  +1 >Ok, Ok, here we go with my reviews which you may or may not agree with.<p>As with all reviews I strongly suggest you go to your local record merchants and ask to listen to any records that look interesting, heard rumours about or are by your favourite recording artist(s) as you only get half the pic. in the written word, but before I talk myself out of a job...<p>

<p>What more can I say about this album apart from it's brilliant!<p>Everything is so smooth:-production,lyrics,everything !<p>I can't even give you tracks to especially check out as they're all so good,but If I have to then there's "Killing Me Softly"-currently getting much play on Westwood.The single "Fu-Gee-La","Ready Or Not".
<p>The list is only restricted by the number of tracks included !  This has got to be a contender for album of the year.<p>

</table><p>O.K it"s a chart track already but so what !<p>A lot of people are knocking the west coast and the gangsta's but this has got to be the hit of the summer.<p>Both sides  have different mixes of the one song but the long remix is the one to go for with way cool piano hook,mad lyrics and superb vocoder singing(Roger"Zapp"Troutman indeed-ed),this is the record you open your windows and play loud,Shake Shake It Baby !!<p>

</table><p>
Some good instrumental Hip-Hop(not the industry saturated genre Trip-Hop but all the way "Instrumental Hip-Hop")<p>Good beats,good sctathing,good stuff !!<p>The only thing is, it would have been a bit better if the long tracks had been shorter and the short tracks are longer (Runaways theme for instance), but there you go. Buy put on, sit and enjoy.

</table>
<p>As with recent Bounty Killer releases this is a rip off of other peoples beats but f**k it, if they all sound good I can't see any problem!<p>This one takes Raekwon's 'Incarcerated Scarfaces' hook and Yankee B blasts out his lyrics over the top.<p>
These records show how popular The Wu are (as if we didn't know already) and they do help to keep things hyped as the build up or around the original track they take from.<p>
The other mixes are quite sad, utilising The South Bronx instrumental which really only sounds great when matched with KRS Ones vocal on the original release.<p>
Nevermind though, it's always nice to hear someone else's interpretations on tracks when they go right (as on the 1st mix) It can be really refreshing and highly danceable.
