<p>With a sample menu as long as your phone cord this remix is a long distance call away from the terrible GREENSLEEVES UK re-hash - after the original went into uncleared sample hiding - ans is definitely Homie-friendly from the word go.<p> I got my copy from Riddim Records in Brighton, but give your dealer a call now!!! <p>

Confusingly on vinyl (!) this mix is broken down onto 4 slabs of mixing madness/genius!<p>As it says on the sleeve, it was done in one non-stop take, no editing or 4 tracks and in places it's not perfect, but that really gives it it's reality and character.<p>Plus there are freestyles from Fat Joe, Redman and Method Man as well as the green eyed monster Erick Sermon. Also look out for the marriage of "Shook Ones" accapella and the Wu's "Nuthin ta F' Wit".<p> <center>As the words on the cover say - Yeah Man!</center><p>

Bit of a disappointment, this 12, but it's still a good track in it's original form (contained here) but the 2 remixes really don't add to the track and aren't that much different to warrant a release.<p>Perhap's the original's big beat was too good to start with and the mixture of Lion's supagruff vocals and the supasweet vocals really can't be made any better - a take over the beats by the Blastermaster himself would have been cool but with a new album by Kris out now, we can't have our cake..<p>

What can you say? As with their CLASSIC HIP-HOP double LP earlier this year (under the Master Cuts banner, but both by Beechwood Music Ltd.) this double pack is worth getting just for nostalgia alone but listen to the tracks (all 12" versions) and you realise it's not just "rose tinted memories" but they really are cool tracks.<p>Hashim, West Street Mob, Tyrone Brunson, all are included here and all phu**ing down today and still 'fresh'!<p>Also the amazing "Clear" by Cybertron (Juan Atkins) which apparently brings about ï¿½80 to anyone mad enough to sell an original copy! So yet another notch on the Streetsound big pole of quality, can't wait for volumes 2, 3, 4, etc!!!<p><HR  noshade width=60% size=2></font><p>
