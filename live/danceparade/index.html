<center><H1><b>BRIGHTON TO HOST UK's 'LOVE PARADE'</b></H1><p>
<H1><b>Latest News - Proposed date: 24th AUGUST</b></H1></center>





<center><H2>Plans are underway for 'The Dance Parade' <br>to be held in Brighton this August</H2>
</center>



	Inspired by the success of DJ Dr Motte's famous Berlin 'Love Parade', which is now in it's seventh year of attracting thousands of dance devotees to the city for the largest dance music festival in the world.  'The Dance Parade' (Brighton '96) hopes to provide a venue for all like minded revellers to participate in an all day event that is being seen as the UK's child of the Berlin 'Love Parade'.<p>

	'The Dance Parade' is being organised by a group of fun loving people, all of whom are committed to the expansion of dance culture.  All the organisers have been deeply involved in cultivating Brighton's progressive underground music and free party scene, which has put Brighton firmly on the map as a cultural Mecca for music and dance lovers of all persuasions. <p> 

	'The Dance Parade' aims to promote environmental issues and mutual understanding alongside the latest in dance music trends.  It will be a free day's entertainment for people of all ages and musical tastes, from Techno to House, Dub to Jungle, Trance to Hardbag(?).<p>

	Approx. 20 carnival style floats, each with their own sound system, will parade through the beautiful town of Brighton. Dancing around the floats of their choice, thousands of colourful party people, dressed to excess, will dance and undulate to the call of the DJ's vinyl as the procession slowly winds it's merry path along the parade route.<p>

 <a HREF=../systems/PositiveSounds.html>Positive Sounds</a> (Brighton), Symbiosis & Helix Records (Brighton), Full Cycle (Bristol), Club Alien (London), Innerfield Sound system (Brighton), <a HREF=../BobDobbs/index.html>BOB</a> and the Church of the SubGenius (Brighton), Ridge Farm Studios (UK), Mosquito Records (Brighton), <a HREF=../charts/d2r/latest.html>Dance 2 Records</a> (UK), <a HREF=../charts/UglyRecords.html>Ugly Records</a> (Brighton), Inter 1 Records (UK), Decompression (St. Albans),, Clueless Sound system (Cambridge), <a HREF=../clubs/Enlightenment.html>Enlightenment</a> (Brighton), The Big Chill (London), Defunkt (Brighton Techno Underground), <a HREF=http://www.xs4all.nl/~zilch/>Zilch</a> (Amsterdam).<p>

 <i>At the moment the Parade is just at the proposal stage, and it will need to be considered by a full Arts and Leisure Committee meeting.  This is unlikely to be before June.</i><p>






	"Dance culture transcends all boundaries.  When people dance together, especially at free events like The Dance Parade, they drop all pretensions and come together in mutual harmony and respect." Kev (organiser)<p>

	"This is an exciting proposal.  But I must stress that it has not yet been agreed.  There are lots of details to be discussed and we will have to consult with traffic officers, residents, traders and police befor a decision can be made."  Councillor Ian Duncan (Chair of the Arts and Leisure Committee.)<p>	

	"In Berlin 'The Love Parade' promotes 'peace, love and the equal distribution of the worlds resources', in Brighton we want to make sure that the world's resources are still around for future generations by promoting environmentally friendly thinking.  Young people are aware of the threat to the environment but they are easily disillusioned when money constantly comes before good sense." Atlanta (organiser)<p>

	"I can't think of a better location than Brighton in which to hold such an important event.  It is sure to become one of the most significant events for British youth culture."  Cristian Vogel (DJ + producer)<p>

	"Brighton has one of the strongest dance cultures in Europe, it's clubs and party organisations reflect the broad diversity of sounds rarely found outside major cities." Steve (organiser)<p>
