      January seems to have passed me by. Probably in a previous life I was a bear - this must account for my intense
      desire to hibernate. The snow has come in and I really can't think of a good enough excuse to venture out. Life in
      Brighton, for me, has slowed to a crawl if not a complete standstill.
    <p>

      This weekend coming I am informed of a party happening somewhere in the region of the town centre. Hopefully I'll
      venture out and report back for you've been starved of party news for weeks, I know...
    <p>

      Meanwhile I've been out there exploring the nether regions of the internet and I'm quite pleased to report quite a
      number of links to this site. Now the URL has changed I'm going to have to e-mail them all to advise of the
      change. More work!
    <p>

      A much fuller posting coming soon....

      Another Friday night, more John Peel. Tonight John Peel is playing a pre-recorded interview with one of cBuzz's
      favourites Dave Clarke. If you don't know Dave then check his stuff out and rest assured you will be familiar with
      him by the end of the year <i>(cBuzz prediction)</i>. I've faxed John Peel tonite as when I did so a couple of
      weeks ago he read my message out; I'll let you know if he mentions it.
    <p>
      So what has been happening in Brighton town? It's been one of those glorious weeks weather wise - pretty cold but
      sunny, sunny, sunny. It's been a joy to get out and about and it seems that the same feeling is happening across
      the town. The month-long post Xmas/New Year hangover seems at an end. The town once more buzzes with activity as
      preperations begin again for what will be happening in the town this summer.
    <p>
      cBuzz is relocating and should be safely incorporated into the new office suite by the time I write the next
      posting. My column in the monthly Impact magazine seems to be going down well - they gave me a full half page this
      month (I got my copy today). My writing career beckons.
    <p>
      On Wednesday I went to the local arthouse cinema (Duke of Yorks) to see Brighton Rock. A film I know (& love)
      really well. I'd never seen it on the big screen before and it only served to reinforce the fact that this
      <b>is</b> the medium in which to watch <b>all</b> films. Though if I stuck to that I would only see a very small
      number of them. Brighton Rock contains many street shots and, as I know the film so well, I indulged in trying to
      spot the locations. Brighton has changed surprisingly little in a lot of parts (and a lot in many!), and these are
      featured in the film. One significant change has been that of the Palace Pier in which the current owners, the
      Noble Organisation, demolished the (listed) Theatre at the sea end with assurances they would rebuild it. Hollow
      assurances indeed as the space previously host to the theatre has now become a fun-fair. I remember vividly
      spending mis-spent schooldays on the pier (yep, I should have been at school). The Theatre was derelict and many
      vain attempts were made to get in and explore. The front part, featured in the film, hosted (at that time) the
      'Penny Machine' Museum; and it's a wonder that the propreitor never challenged us about our absence from school.
      Fishermen were also allowed to fish from the pier and it was one of the Noble Organisation's first moves to kick
      off those people partaking in this truly ancient harvest involving the sea.
    <p>

      John Peel hasn't mentioned the fax yet and I move towards signing off. The cBuzz <a
        HREF=../radio/index.html>Radio</a> pages have been resurrected and if you, like me, are interested in all things
      radio then have a look and submit anything you have to say

      Another Friday and another week of this fascinating year has flown by. It's been a week of compliments for cBuzz
      and this column and I can't write further without a mention to possibly the greatest mac designer I know <i>(now
        will you rush through that brochure?)</i> Rachelle, who will very soon have a little bit of cBuzz to herself...
    <p>

      ....so where was I? Ah yes, the week that's just departed. cBuzz is in the office transition stage and as soon as
      British Telecom get there act together me and the rest of the team will be situated equidistantly from four of
      Brighton's finest pubs (not to mention the hundreds of others within a reasonable staggering distance). Expect
      more incoherent postings in the future
    <p>
      Got to see the press showing of Othello which I confess, quite happily, to not knowing. Excepting the general gist
      of the story I had picked up with the help of an episode of Cheers! Expect a review on this site next week - I
      will just say it's a powerful film and that Shakespeare had a way of telling stories. And a perception of man's
      inner existence. And must have been one hell of a cynical guy!
    <p>
      I'm off to Manchester for three days to see if it's true that Northerners can party better than us Southerners.
      I'm also driving Strata 3 as they've got to spend a couple of days in the studio (album on its' way) and are
      guesting on Kiss FM Manchester on Monday nite (12/2/1996). Tune in if you're in the reception area.
    <p>
      Well I've got to pack my gladdest rags and I've still got loose ends to tie up before heading North (and towards
      the snow!), tomorrow.
    <p>Before I go I must draw your attention to the latest addition (below) to this page. As I traverse this delightful
      town of ours I do so in company of my trusted walkman. So to give you all a flavour of the soundtracks
      accompanying my wanderings I introduce the "<b>what's on the walkman section</b>". If you want your band/music
      featured then send tapes to cBuzz, PO Box 2724, Brighton. BN1 6FZ Bribes will certainly ensure a plug, but
      otherwise I'll truly inform you of what's tickling my eardrums

      Again a lot has been happening in cBuzzland, but first I must tell of my journeys to Manchester. A pretty fab &
      groovy weekend was had by us all (apart from Strata 3 who I'm glad to say worked damn hard in the studio and,
      believe me, their next release is going to be MEGA) and I delighted in the throes of the Manchester club scene.
      Holy City Zoo was the club that came out on top as it's just about the size I really like and it was a simple blag
      in !!! (Though I think that being with one of the bosses of Bush records helped somewhat!) The Dry Bar comes well
      recommended and the baked potatos in the Night & Day bar next door are just too big. I must also pay kind regards
      to the Mancunian hospitality from Michelle & Sandra; I'll be headed North again soon....
    <p>

      <a name=22feb>date: </a><b>22nd February 1996</b>
    <p>
      My last posting was somewhat brief. Lots to write but pressure to get on with other editing meant I finished it
      far sooner than I intended.
    <p>
      On returning from Manchester I took part in a Reclaim The Streets action here in Brighton. The idea behind RTS is
      for large numbers of people to occupy a car congested street for a period of hours showing how quickly the
      environment improves and what can be done positively in such an area. The action was well supported and good
      natured though the police seemed determined to adopt a confrontational attitude. The following is a letter I sent
      to the local paper (Evening Argus) which was printed (though edited) amongst many such supportive letters:
    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=5>
      <tr>
        <td colspan=4 rowspan=1>15th February 1996<p>

            I am writing concerning the "Reclaim The Streets" action in Brighton yesterday and the associated media
            coverage.
          <p>

            I was present and supportive of yesterdays' action and felt that, despite the police attitude surrounding
            the area, the protest was both good natured and well supported.
          <p>

            Upon arrival I was prevented, by the police, from moving through the police line formed across North Road.
            Their action at this time appeared to consist of enclosing and reducing the area of North Road being
            occupied by the demonstrators; this was the activity that resulted in pedestrians being stopped from walking
            the streets and any resultant loss to businesses. Many shoppers were advised by the police that the shopping
            areas in the vicinity were "out of bounds".
          <p>

            Whilst accepting that the occupation of this highway was an illegal activity the nature of the police
            appeared to be that this protest was to be ended by whatever means they were able to so do. The geniality of
            the crowd, in which many families and young children were in attendance, was constantly challenged by the
            continued aggresive attitude of many officers.
          <p>

            My belief of the nature of this protest, as in similar protests held in London and other towns, was to
            occupy the street showing how quickly the environment improves with the lack of cars and vehicles, and to
            create an alternative demonstration of the benefits of pedestrianised areas. The police reaction was
            designed to frustrate this end, though the demonstrators were equally determined to protest and party. I
            stayed in attendance until just before 4pm when I went to meet up with my son arriving home from school.
          <p>

            On returning to North Road the atmosphere and police activity had changed somewhat. The police were
            re-enacting scenes from the miner's strike as they formed tight lines and aggressively moved the protestors
            on. They seemed keen to do this as quickly as possible, maybe to clear the road before the 'rush hour'. By
            this time most motorists intending to use this route would have been aware of the action (Southern Counties
            Radio had been reporting on the events since the early afternoon) and would have prepared alternative
            routes. There was no real urgency to clear the protesters; the police, however, seemed to wish to provoke a
            potentially aggresive situation to meet their ends.
          <p>

            Your paper reports of "a hail of missiles" to which the police came under. Whilst not denying that one or
            two 'missiles' appeared to be thrown, the emphasis of your report would appear to challenge the validity of
            your reporters. As to the assertion of activists "climbing on to the rooftops of nearby buildings to throw
            glass bottles and cans" it must be emphasised that to all of us that saw those climbing on roofs (maybe two
            or three) none were carrying any 'missiles' (glass bottles and cans?) as their hands were too involved with
            scaling the rooftops to be carrying such items. And no, they didn't have rucksacks full of potential
            missiles!
          <p>

            In today's paper no mention is made of the Bouncy Castle erected in the street, a provision for the children
            there alongside many other such activities which were unfortunately not able to be realised (entertainers,
            bands, face painting, Candy Floss etc).
          <p>

            Yesterday's paper made great emphasis on the inability of one motorist to get quickly from Spring Gardens to
            Queens Gardens (an amazingly short distance for someone to be utilising a car for); indicative of the
            car-based society we find ourselves living in -- where news importance is related directly to the 'rights'
            of the motorist. It is to this that such illegal protests will continue as generations realise the damage
            the motor car creates at the expense of us humans.
          <p>

            I urge all concerned individuals to support future activities; this issue will not go away and it is a
            greater display of democracy to be involved than to make indications on ballot papers for party-chosen
            political candidates who have their party's vested interests at heart over the real views of the local
            electorate.
          <p>

            Brighton would survive as a shopping and entertainment centre with far greater 'car-free' areas than
            presently exist. I will contend that not only would it survive but that it would be more attractive to
            visitors who have to currently contend with our high levels of traffic.
          <p>

            The By-Pass, opposed by many, has been built taking much of Stanmer Park (bequeathed to the people of
            Brighton as a park!) and should therefore now be made to take all of our town's through traffic; this can be
            enforced with greater pedestrianisation. The issue of a tram system for Brighton should also be incorporated
            - such as the very efficient system in Manchester, which has led directly to less vehicles on the streets of
            Manchester.
          <p>

            But the issue doesn't end there. Reclaim The Streets means exactly that. The car has taken a stranglehold of
            our society and it is no wonder that there is major opposition to such road projects as the Newbury By-Pass.
            The whole issue of transport policy needs to be addressed on a national basis - and this will only take
            place if we, the people, make such demands. This means that actions such as yesterdays will continue.
          <p>

            As someone who will continue to be involved I apologise if such actions cause inconvenience to individuals.
            However they can be no greater an inconvenience than those the car creates:
          <p>
            -- the inconvenience of high levels of asthma (and related illnesses) in our children and the resultant
            medical costs and suffering;
          <p>
            -- the inconvenience of road accidents to the emergency services and those who are personally involved.

      Following this action many people felt that the police action was far too aggressive and a public meeting was held
      at the Brighton Unemployed Centre in which well over a hundred people turned up. Not one felt that the police
      action was justified.
    <p>I spent quite a while on the telephone in discussion with Charlotte Harris from Brighton Police Press & Public
      Relations office. She maintained that for quite a few hours the action was "fairly good natured" and they "wanted
      them <i>(the protesters)</i> to have the ability to protest". The police on the ground maintained liason with one
      of the protesters, who, apparently, informed the police (when it was beginning to disperse) that some of the
      protesters were not prepared to move on. The decision appeared to be taken to break the remainder of the demo up
      by force.
    <p>I left the demo at approx. 3.55pm and returned about half an hour later. In that time the bouncy castle had been
      deflated and packed away and very soon after the police forcibly moved in. I questioned whether, considering it
      must take a good ten minutes to deflate & pack away the bouncy castle, an adequate amount of time had elapsed to
      allow the demo to disperse. She maintained that this had been. A supposed 'verbal warning' was given to the crowd
      however the police themselves admit that this was "possibly not heard by the crowd" as the drummers turned up
      their volume as it was given! Shouldn't the police <b>ensure</b> the crowd had heard such a warning before
      adopting such strong-arm tactics?
    <p>Three Metropolitan police officers were in Brighton to advise Chief Inspector Martyn Bailey of the best way to
      police such an action. Apparently they were not in attendance on the ground but remained at John Street station.
      (why?). The only advice the Brighton Police took from the Met. officers was to remove any scaffolding poles that
      might be erected. This they did at the beginning of the action which resulted in someone falling off the poles,
      though not injured (from what I know), this could have been more worrying and the manner in which this was done
      should now be considered, retrospectively, quite ominous.
    <p>Brighton Police have no intention to examine their actions on this day though they will deal with individual
      complaints as and when they arise. Personally I am keen to see the whole events discussed at a Police Authority
      meeting and will be contacting my local councillors to ensure that this is done.
    <p>
      More has been happening in Brighton than just this event and I will cover more in due course - I just wanted to
      begin to get the records straight over Reclaim The Streets. If you wish to have an input on this then get in touch
      and I will endeavour to reflect all opinions on the day.
