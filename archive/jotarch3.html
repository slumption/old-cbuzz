      Well it's October already and everyone I know seems to have their birthday between now and Christmas. Guess you
      lot should accept that not are you not going to get a present but I'm probably not going to even remember to get
      you cards. So have <b>Happy Birthdays</b> and when it comes along I'll direct you to this greeting. That's that
      sorted.
    <p>Once again I haven't got back here as quickly as I'd intended and it seems that so much has happened. The Sub
      cafe is now open so get along. Two new clubs are set to open over the next six months so keep checking out
      <b>cBuzz</b> for the latest info. Check out <a HREF=../bars/HectorsHouse.html>Hector's House</a> listings. Check
      out Promoters Corner - which you'll see is beginning to fill up as the local promoters finally realise where I
      am!!
    <p>
      In the last week I haven't actually got very far from my computer - except to leaflet the University of Brighton
      Freshers Fair to get more readers logging in. Brighton is beginning to take on it's autumnal colours as the annual
      student return is once more upon us. Thinking back to last week I did get away from my computer - mainly to drink
      coffee in cafes. And observe. Observe the changing face of Brighton as the new generation of students settle in.
      The women seem positive and radiant as they discover the new town that is to be their home for three years. The
      men are distinctly furtive and unsure of themselves and can easily be spotted as the freshmen they are. Wow, with
      these sort of observations I'll be able to call myself a sociologist soon!
    <p>

      <a name=5oct>date: </a><b>5th October 1995</b>
    <p>This is a first for me....updating this section two days in a row. Things must definitely be coming together.
      Really, though, I needed to write some more as I was distracted while putting together yesterdays posting.
      Distracted by the fact that, despite not having updated this section in nearly a week, I quickly realised that I
      had to fix a couple of bugs in some of my pages and update some listings that were a little inaccurate. All's well
      now, though.
    <p>Tuesday night I went to the press showing of the excrutiatingly over-hyped <a
        HREF=../reviews/films/TheNet.html>"The Net"</a> starring Sandra Bullock. To be honest the film surpassed my
      expectations (admittedly they weren't very high) but was just a little too glitzy and Hollywood to be more than of
      passing interest. The film loses it's way a little but if you are like me, in terms of your interest in computers
      and the internet, then it's worth a visit. Uncannily the computer firm Ms Bullock works for, "Cathedral" uses an
      underground style logo that I am using on printed material to promote cBuzz locally (keep logging-in here to see
      the new logo within these pages) - in fact I'll just put it here for it's debut......

    <p>I know it's mono but then so are my flyers!! I'm working on the all-colour, all-singing version as soon as I'm
      done here. Final note on "The Net", you don't have to look too carefully to spot which type of machine is used
      constantly. Is it just good product placement or can we credit our transatlantic cousins with knowing what machine
      you really should be using. And you can spot Apple's e-world being plugged at the computer expo. Don't take my
      word for it, leave your terminals behind for a short while to watch other people at their terminals; and can you
      entrepreneurial ones out there sort out a pizza delivery that I can order from right here 'cause when I'm on-line
      I can't make a call to them - and it's most often when I'm stuck in to a long on-line session that I most need
      that service. Go to it!
    <p>Wednesday night was spent in delightful company eating a wonderful meal. Unfortunately I had to depart early,
      parental committments again, but it was an enjoyable time to interact socially away from a computer screen. The
      special friend that cooked was particularly stressed living dangerously in cooking a meal they'd never made before
      and battling a heavy bout of flu; all I can say is that the food and its' flavours are still fresh to my memory
      and tastebuds as I write this 5 hours later. Now I could eat it all again and would gladly love to. Thanks.
    <p>
      It's early Thursday morning and their are only two weekdays left this week. I'm still attempting to take it easy
      on the party front and hope to spend the Saturday night inland away from the sea. Not that I don't like the sea,
      it remains a deep part of my psyche and I can never bear to be far from it's shores, it just so happens that in
      Crawley this weekend Douglas Rushkoff (see <a HREF=../questionnaire>cBuzz interview</a> 1) is in town to lead an
      open-day on the Internet as well as chairing a discussion on the future and potential difficulties of our
      (internet) times. More details from the <a HREF=http://www.pncl.co.uk/hawth/hawth.html>Hawth</a> website. I've got
      some really good friends that live nearby and I'm hoping to get them to put me up for the night.
    <p>And when I get back to Brighton I can renew that acquaintance with the sea - what did you think the C in
      <b>cBuzz</b> stood for? (as well as cyber). Take care. Back soon.

    <p>
      It's late Sunday night and once again the weekend has been one of excess. Despite the good intentions to get away
      from Brighton this weekend I failed miserably. Saturday I joined the <b>Critical Mass</b> action - a monthly
      demonstration against the overuse of cars and their polluting effect on the Brighton atmosphere. This action is
      well received by (surprisingly) motorists and pedestrians alike. The action is 'spontaneous' and involves a large
      number of cyclists cycling slowly around the town en masse. The resultant traffic congestion outlines our
      over-dependence on the motor vehicle and effectively draws attention to our message. More on <b>Critical Mass</b>
      in these pages soon...
    <p>Following <b>Critical Mass</b> I was struck down by a particularly raging migraine and was unable to proceed
      inland to Crawley <i>(see last posting)</i>. Later I felt recovered enough to venture out in search of food and
      spent a couple of hours in the relaxed atmosphere of Food for Friends, Brighton's original vegetarian restaurant.
      Returning home to do a spot of work on the computer I popped by the New Kensington where I was reminded that a
      friend was having a birthday party. Feeling guilty regarding the work I needed to do I decided to get home and do
      some work before joining in the festivities, getting to the party at about 1am. And what an excellent party it was
      - arriving home at about 6.30am!!
    <p>After a few hours sleep I ventured off to the Green Dragon for a spot of Sunday lunch, rerturning home for more
      sleep. Sleep dispensed with another couple of hours was spent on the computer then I headed off to the Richmond
      for a benefit gig for <b>Free State</b>, a new listings magazine to hit the Brighton streets in November. Lots
      more jumping around to techno being played by the same DJs that had been at the party the night before (Oz, Flip
      etc.); despite being invited to an after party at Black Rock I resisted temptation and headed to the Sub Cafe for
      a cup of tea (wot, no soya milk!) and a chilled atmosphere. I recommend this cafe very highly and hope it remains
      a constant feature of Brighton life.
    <p>
      Well once again I draw towards the end of my missive and look longingly towards my bed.... I will undoubtedly get
      some more words down in the next few days; I'm actually enjoying sharing my experiences of the Brighton scene with
      all who read this section and would appreciate any more feedback that you lot want to give. Take care.
    <p>

      Twelve days since I last wrote and it feels like two months! Quite a lot has been happening and I've been pretty
      active despite feeling like shit. Trying deperately to fight off this flu-bug everyone seems to be suffering with.
    <p>
      Roughly three days after Critical Mass I had the honourable pleasure of having my trusted bike stolen. Quite a
      bummer really as I was working with a friend on his Mac at the time putting together a flyer for the Box! Anyhow I
      hope you bastards needed it more than me as it's seriously slowed down my ability to travel across town. So I'm
      looking for some sponsorship from a bike shop or so that involves a new machine! Any offers?
    <p>
      On the good news front <b>cBuzz</b> has secured a sponsorship arrangement with a drink mentioned previously in
      this column! Sponsoring the bars section for a period of six months should see a rapid increase in development of
      this section as we present our guide to bars worth checking out in Brighton. Anyhow if you haven't worked out who
      the sponsor is you'll have to be patient!!
    <p>
      On the local scene front <b>cBuzz</b> will be featuring even more pages real soon and will undergo a restructuring
      in the next few days. We're also involved with the launch of the Brighton Venue Campaign to lobby for the old Top
      Rank Bingo Hall in North Street, Brighton, (which recently closed down), to become a venue of capacity 1-1,500 .
      The campaign consists of a good cross-section of people involved in band and club promotion and all believe that
      this town could benefit greatly from such a venue. The Brighton Venue Campaign's pages will be available in
      <b>cBuzz</b> as soon as the campaign is officially launched. We'll also be detailing exactly who the supporters
      are and if you want to be involved or associated then <a href=mailto:cbuzz@mistral.co.uk> e-mail cBuzz</a> with
      <b>BVC</b> as the subject.
    <p>
      It's Friday night and once again I'm in on the computer! I love it really *! John Peel does his best to keep my
      mind occupied enough to concentrate on the computer but once again he's stuck a really kicking techno track on
      that makes me want to be out there jumping around. Luckily I know that there's going to be a full-on party
      tomorrow night (Saturday) with Blue Room Sound in aid of Radio Kamikaze (soon to be Pirate Radio station for
      Brighton). Keep your ears peeled for the location of this one and don't forget some silver for the buckets. See
      you there.

      It's Hallowe'en again and I'm off out to see Stanton Friedman's talk at the Dome in Brighton (about UFOs and all
      that). But I don't expect to be doing too much partying after that as my life has just become far too busy!
    <p>As you can see another eleven days have passed since I last contributed to this column and those eleven days have
      rushed past me! I've moved address and despite believing the whole process could be completed in a day it took the
      best part of a week to be really sorted. Do we ever learn? It's my fourth move this year and I'm hoping to remain
      at the same address for a while at least. Thank God (sorry, BOB) for e-mail, at least that doesn't go astray when
      you move!!
    <p>The Brighton Venue Campaign (BVC) has been absorbing a fair deal of my time as we endeavour to gain support for
      it's ideals prior to the launch 'proper'. As promised full details on BVC will appear in <b>cBuzz</b> real soon.
    <p>
      Last weekend I went to see Zion Train @ The Concorde and all I can say is FUCKING BRILLIANT. They had me dancing
      far more enthusiastically than I actually had the energy for; though the arsehole who had obviously been
      practicing his steps in his bedroom will have to learn about dancing in limited space. A full venue (rammed,
      actually) restricts somewhat the ability to flail around mindlessly - though he continued despite seemingly
      pissing off everyone around him. Go away, wanker! (or back to your student bedsit for the remainder of your
      course).
    <p>
      That off my chest I can assure you the rest of the night was mighty fine (thanks, G). A hallowe'en party around a
      friends, then <a HREF=../cafes/Subcafe.html>Subcafe</a>, then home! (another 7am crawl-in!). During the course of
      the night the philosophy obtained ran along the lines of "leave the party before the party leaves you" - try it
      out. You might not get laid but you'll have a laugh bubbling around. Must Go - it's November tomorrow and the new
      month brings new work! (and lots of it) See Ya
