      <font size=+1>It's been quite a while since time allowed me to grace more words on these pages and, despite
        earlier requests to update these pages, I'm afraid it will only be a brief encounter.
        <p>Brief Encounters reminds me of the fact that many of my internet user friends seem to be making new
          acquaintances through these channels. Virtual Pubs (particularly Irish ones) seem to be the best hangouts I'm
          told...if romance blossoms I'll be the first to report...
        <p>
          So what of the world of Brighton - same story, I'm afraid...continual rounds of parties followed by days spent
          recovering and attempting to do work on the computer. I've moved (again) and so have the cBuzz offices (twice
          in one month). My flat is right above the cBuzz office and thus I really am living above the shop! Should
          increase my workrate somewhat...but the fact that I'm now very definitely living in Central Brighton could
          provide alternative distractions.
        <p>
          Spring is definitely trying to break through though the nights still seem to be getting very cold. The flowers
          are defying the icy winds that still chill the body as I try to believe I don't need my hat anymore. My
          spring/summer wardrobe is beginning to get an airing.
        <p>
          Well, that's about it for the moment - I'll be back before this March is out...

      <FONT SIZE=+1>Back again, I hear you say, and I only wrote forty-eight hours ago. Well it's a special sort of
        message, this one. For it is exactly a year since the very first page of cBuzz went on-line. The proper party is
        going to take place in May in the very-soon to be opened Cybar. Part of the new Lighthouse Media Centre the
        Cybar will bring the internet to the heart of Brighton. And a bar. And a restaurant. More news of the Cybar very
        soon and details of the birthday party to follow.<P>
          Meanwhile I should better fill in the regular readers of these jottings with news of Swell FM, the radio
          service I'm involved within that I said would be broadcasting this April. For many reasons, far too many to
          detail, Swell FM will be broadcasting this summer during July and August. Swell will be covering the
          <B>EnBrightonment</B> Festival, <B>Brighton Festival of Freedom</B>, <B>Brighton's</B> answer to the Berlin
          <B>Love Parade</B> and the <B>Dope sponsored skate day</B> during its' month on air. Details on all these
          events and the Swell website will be appering in cBuzz in the near future.
        <P>Well I'm off to contemplate this year that has seen the birth, teething and now first steps and words in the
          organic world of this baby that's christened cBuzz. Walkman details the same as before - The Orb know, don't
          they?
