      <font size=+1>Well, once again it's taken me a hell of a long time to get back to you all!! And for a lot of
        people this could be their first reading of the jottings as they do so from the cBuzz party @ The CYBAR -
        Welcome to you all, and I hope you enjoy what I have to say enough for you to make the net connection regularly
        to read my thoughts(!). Why not come back to the CYBAR again.<p>

          Apologies to those who have been waiting for this posting (and yes, I have had e-mails urging me on), this
          party organisation business seems to take up far more time than you'd imagine - but at least in the course of
          it all I met someone who I reckon I might bring in to organise the second birthday party! Delegation can
          sometimes really ease the pressure - but no-one seems to want to have the nervous breakdown for me; some
          things you just can't delegate.
        <p>

          Summer in Brighton is threatening to be a good one, <A HREF="../live/danceparade/index.html">Dance
            Parades</A>, Wicked radio stations - <A HREF="../swell/index.html">Swell FM</A>, superbly planned live acts
          and club nights at the <A HREF="../live/Concorde/index.html">Concorde</A>, sexy looking Club nights at the <A
            HREF="../clubs/warehouse.html">Warehouse</A>, more diversity with the <A
            HREF="../clubs/Retreat/index.html">Retreat</A>, the ever continuing party offerings from <A
            HREF="../systems/PositiveSounds.html">Positive Sounds</A>, the Brighton Festival of Freedom in August, and
          the list goes on. Rest assured if you want to get the true picture of this happening town of Brighton, and as
          it happens, then cBuzz will be here to guide you through the 'happenings'
        <p>

          A big thankyou here to all who've helped get cBuzz through its' first 14 months (yeah, I know the birthday
          party's late but we were waiting for the Cybar to open up - and it's always a great time to have a party in
          Brighton during the International Festival). The reason for that is that this 'wonderful' Festival of ours
          seems to offer so very little for the people catered to by cBuzz; the reason we just don't really cover a lot
          of what's happening. Maybe next year we'll put together a guide to those (limited) events that will be of
          interest (the FREE ones!!!). I've had my fill of arty types and opera lovers. This invasion by the middle
          classes is possibly just a little wearing when for 11 months of the year it's hard working Brighton people
          that make this town tick. Where's the festival for US (AND the fireworks - FREE - were disrupted by an IRA
          bomb scare; to be re-scheduled during the HUGE Essential Festival). Well done Ish for doing what many
          Brightonians have tried to do for years. I remember the USTA bars carnival from which this has grown; and
          grown it certainly has. Just a shame that there is SO much on; you could spread all the acts out throughout
          every weekend of the year and still run out of weekends. How about it then, Ish, a week long Festival for next
          year? Meantime a supply of tickets for all the cBuzz crew will ensure full coverage of all that's going on in
          the illustrious pages of cBuzz.
        <P>

          Before I go a final message to the party goers - now you've seen the actuality of cBuzz; rather than me
          drunkenly telling you all about it late at night in some slub somewhere, you may see the potential. This can
          only be realised with your input. From film reviewing to show reviewing to column writing your assistance is
          needed. cBuzz has got through it's first year and achieved a great deal. We're not going away now and we're up
          for development in many areas. We're not aiming to be a conclusive guide to Brighton; but we want to document
          'our' Brighton as progressively as possible. I've been accused of representing the 'crusty' side of Brighton
          and if that means the side of Brighton that is exciting and vibrant then I accept that charge. The local clubs
          and bars and promoters seem keen to work with me and their support, both now and for the future, looks set to
          ensure we survive. Our ideas are fresh and you won't find us playing catch-up with other websites. We might
          not have loads of (slow to load) flashy graphics, scrolling little bittys, or even try to incorporate all the
          possible new features of Netscape etc just to prove we can do it. What we have is CONTENT that people have a
          genuine interest in finding out. We shall continue to be content driven 'cause we believe in utilising the
          internet both to give info of interest and to provide the space to put a real (not virtual) Brighton
          perspective on the net.
        <P>
          As for me I move on, albeit briefly; the jottings shall continue (and possibly be a little more regular and
          less erratic). Dave (believe me, your surname <B>will</B> now be cBuzz!) is taking on the donkey work as I
          seek to regain a life away from the continual glare of the computer and attempt to deliver Brighton's first
          multi-media approach to local radio. In August I shall have my first holiday in a long while and I truly
          cannot wait. In the meantime <A HREF="../swell/index.html">Swell FM</A> follows. Thank you all for your
          indulgences, and I can only apologise for the number of unwritten rants/moans/commentaries I have wanted to
          write; but forced through the passage of time to discard.
