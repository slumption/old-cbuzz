      <font size=+1>Well well well... quite some time since I was last here and thus there's loads for me to say yet I'm
        sure I'll forget most of it! Times are really exciting and particularly buzzy. That's not just an excuse for my
        lack of attention to the jottings page but the reality is that life has become hectic.<p>Most people that know
          me would claim that I'm pretty hectic doing nothing so the fact that I can be hectic doing loads of shit ain't
          necessarily a bad thing. The success, and continuance, of cBuzz is dependent upon it!!
        <p>So where have I been these past few weeks... as I said before I left you I was going to see the Stanton
          Friedman talk @ The Dome. Pretty good but didn't tell me anything about the UFO conspiracy that I didn't
          already know and was reminiscent of those classroom/lecture hall experiences that shape us into good citizens.
          Quite a chilled Hallowe'en as we haven't quite got the party buzz our American cousins have for this occasion.
          States next year if anyone can provide some accomodation and an excellent party.
        <p>Bonfire Night was spent at Ridge Farm recording studios for another kicking party, featuring a 'surround'
          sound system that was not pushed by the DJs - next time lets have some techno (not all the time, but let's
          have some).
        <p>Last Friday (a week ago as I'm listening to John Peel again) I went to the Apple Expo in London, an
          exhibition of all the latest Apple hardware & software. Most uplifted by where we are within the wider
          computer scene. It seems that a large majority of Apple users are ignorant and a little unsure of the
          internet; what we are doing is showing just one way in which the internet can be utilised for information &
          communication in a progressive way.
        <p>That was on the 10th November and for more than one reason this date will be ingrained upon my eternal annual
          calendar - for my cat, Joe, died. Pretty gutting as he'd been a better mate than some I've had; he possessed
          great qualities and could be particularly jealous and indifferent when my attentions were elsewhere. He taught
          me many more lessons than a lot of humans could ever do. Last weekend was spent in mourning, which involved
          getting pretty drunk and morose at the Positive Sounds mixing competition (Concorde, Saturday); burial (in
          which I gave Joe a good send off) Sunday followed by a chilled night @ Cafe Expose.
        <p>This week I've been looking after a (surf) shop for a friend who's in the States catching some autumn waves
          and have been burning the candle at both ends as I spend my nights putting <b>cBuzz</b>
          together. Sleep is definitely at a premium. Got out a couple of times as well getting to Fluke @ the Paradox
          with a great bunch of people and running into lots of good heads as well. Fluke are good and worth seeing but
          didn't work the crowd as well as Oz did DJing after their set. A great night out, could've been better if it
          weren't raining and wintry.
        <p>Whilst in the surf shop (Bone Idol) on Thursday I ran into the bass player of Chumbawamba who I got on well
          with. He came back later in the day to let me know that he'd put me (+ one) on the guest list and insisted I
          came to the gig later. Despite having promised myself an early night I sorted out a babysitter and set off to
          the gig with my flatmate. On arrival one of Brighton's premier promoters informed myself that all 'plus-ones'
          on the guest list had been cancelled. Only after getting pretty annoyed with the situation and venturing off
          to track down Paul, the bass player, did the illustrious John Penfold, for it was he, finally 'find' that he
          could allow my flatmate, and another guy in a similar situation an entry. Cheers, I needed the only pint I
          could afford to chill-out to the level I had been previously at (not very chilled). It's a rich attitude when
          the blag was genuine and you spend many long hours promoting Brighton gigs and clubs in this arena of
          cyberspace. Meanwhile the <a HREF=http://www.indian.co.uk/chumba />Chumbas have a website</a> so have a look
          in.
        <p>Well still more pages to do and I want to get out to Dreadzone @ Brighton Centre East Wing tomorrow (18th
          Nov) nite (promoted by a Mr Penfold). And Cafe Expose @ Oasis Sunday nite. See you out.

      <font size=+1>Another long period between postings....what can I say. It gets hard sometimes to squeeze everything
        in; and, unfortunately, this area of my activities seems to be the first to get overlooked. I'll keep working on
        it.<p>So what can I report of the current Brighton scene - not much as I have been too busy to even look out of
          the window. That's a lie, really, it just feels like everythings on top at the moment.
        <p>The mighty and illustrious Brighton & Hove Albion FC beat Canvey Island in the cup 4-1 (so they should have
          but I mention it here as I went along with delightful company). Next stop in this push for the cup (?) is
          Craven Cottage on Saturday where we'll take out Fulham.
        <p>
          Despite the fact that I haven't been out too much I have been pretty busy working with a team committed to
          putting a radio station together for a month next April. Swell FM has premises to broadcast, a team of
          volunteers ready for the off and enough radio experience to put together a swell service. Just need to get
          that all elusive station sponsor on board and you can be sure that a trip to Brighton next April would be
          amiss without tuning in. More information on Swell will be arriving on these pages soon (as soon as we've got
          the new URL confirmed).
        <p>
          New URL, I hear you say...well I guess it's out now. The cBuzz website should be moving really soon. (We had
          hoped to have moved site by now but these things can get complicated). The new URL should be:<br>
          <center><b>http://www.cbuzz.co.uk/</b></center><br>so make a note of it now. We shall be providing the link to
          the new site from this site as soon as everythings set up (very, very soon).
        <p>So the real reason is out that the pages haven't been growing too much, rest assured on moving that this site
          will be a continously expanding and entertaining area of the web.
          Meanwhile my recommendation for a night out this weekend has got to be Athletico @ The Blue Note club in North
          London. Curtis Child & Strata 3 are playing and I will definitely be there (Sat 2nd Dec). In the meantime,
          till I get back here, bear in mind my birthday is coming up later in December and I wanted to invite some
          people from the internet. So if you're interested in a night out in Brighton then send me a message, the
          further you are away the better!! (Though I don't think cBuzz can stretch to travel expenses!).
          It does concern me that so many people decorate their streets and houses for the occasion of my birthday, I
          guess all I can do is offer my humble appreciation.<br>
          See you @ the Blue Note...
