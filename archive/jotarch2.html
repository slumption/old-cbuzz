      Well once again a busy week for me. Last Saturday a truly enjoyable night was had by everyone @ The Concorde as
      <b>Lobe</b> launched their bid for stardom beyond the Brighton boundaries by releasing their single <b>'Doin
        It'</b> - good luck guys. Unfortunately too high a consumption of alcohol prevented the night going on for me -
      I've since heard of a kickin' party I missed (I regularly miss the so-called best ones and I reckon it's a
      conspiracy to make out that a better time is had by one and all when I ain't there; or am I just getting a little
      paranoid!).
    <p>
      Sunday night was spent at <b>Cafe Expose</b>, a weekly performance night @ The Stable pub in Brighton put on by
      some mates. The trippy, ambient sounds were provided by Kit, Mel and Simon and the food (delicious, too) by Jenny.
      Check it out (only 50p) - it's in Albion Street just round the back of the Richmond.
    <p>
      Tuesday heralded the birthday of the infamous Spanna - partygoer extraordinaire and a regular feature of Brighton
      nitelife. So off to the Concorde again for another buzzin night of techno tunes from Darius & Nicky - both
      excellent and ensuring I stayed on the dancefloor. Post party hospitality was provided by Lee and Fay - she
      insisted I plug her birthday bash @ The Escape next Tuesday (12th Sept) with DJs Nicky & Oz - and then the party
      continued @ Black Rock until the early hours. A wicked nite.
    <p>
      Tonite @ The Escape - if you're in the area then check out <b>The Box</b>, Electronic underground techno club with
      Club Sativa resident Dave Tarrida, Brighton's own (soon to be MASSIVE) Christian Vogel and Nick Spice also
      (upstairs) Astral Engineering, E.A.S.E. and Matt Consume. (Just �4/3)
    <p>
      Friday night in Brighton and my recommendation this week is to head for The Loft. Brighton United present
      <b>Come</b> from 10.30 til 2. With hard house to nu NRG upstairs and cheesy listening disco down!! Guest DJs
      ensure a happy variety for happy housey people - guaranteed to start the weekend off well.
    <p>
      Saturday sees our very own Chrissie Eubank attempt to win back his crown. It's getting very difficult to decide
      whether to stay in and watch it, then party or to head to the big smoke where <b>bumpy capers</b> present
      <b>BOB</b>. Yep, the very same Bob that has his website contained within cBuzz. For your info. it's being held @
      plastic people, 37 Oxford Street, London W1. From 10.30 til 6 and featuring the DJ skills of Darius, Vitamin Ian &
      residents. (�8/6 - AND with instant answers to everything)
    <p>
      Well, if the opportunity arises I'll try to inform you more of what to do this weekend. If not you'll soon find
      out how I spent mine!
    <p>
      <a name=12sept>date:</a> <b>12th September 1995</b>
    <p>
      Well firstly apologies for not getting back here and giving you the lowdown on exactly what to do here in Brighton
      last weekend. Personally I had the quietest weekend for a while. Friday night was spent watching telly and
      ignoring the fact that I should have been diligently sat in front of the computer.
    <p>Saturday night I opted to watch Crissie Boy get slaughtered. I reckon I must be the last remaining Brightonian to
      actually still support him - the rest have just got a little pissed off with his egotistical adventures about town
      - the latest being to drive his US-style truck cab through the narrow streets of the old lanes! Anyway, I really
      rooted for you Chris and still believed you could dig deep and do it from as late as the ninth but you let me
      down. Come back and prove those harpers wrong.
    <p>
      Sunday spent inside watching the rain. If it had lifted for any period I would've gone to the windsurfing
      championships, which was going off on the Friday when the wind was gusty and quite a swell. But I didn't make it
      and will have to wait another year. I prefer proper surfing anyway.
    <p>
      And now it's Tuesday - the last day or so spent getting hold of all the charts and flyers for what's coming up.
      And putting it up here. Christ you can get mighty pissed off with your computer at times - but not now. I'm due to
      go out down the Escape for Fay's Birthday party (which is also a post festival of freedom benefit) to listen to
      the delightful tunes served up by Nikki, Oz & Lettuce. But I've just got a new toy. A nice new colour printer; not
      a laser one, mind, 'cause this cBuzz operation is run on a shoestring. Well, not even a shoestring, actually, as
      the printer is borrowed. The good news is the period is indefinite (yep, we've got fans snd supporters out there
      who believe in us) and I just want to spend the whole night long printing and printing and printing.....
    <p>
      But I won't let you lot out there down 'cause I know y'all want me to celebrate Fay's birthday and tell you all
      about it later. So I will...latest listings and recommendations for night's out coming from the cBuzz crew very
      soon.
    <p>
      <a name=15sept>date:</a> <b>15th September 1995</b>
    <p>
      Friday night and I've got too much work on to even contemplate going out. Which is just as well as my son is
      staying over and he's not too keen on clubbing yet!
    <p>
      Following on from my last posting I did go to Fay's party; however on the way I checked out the Positive Sounds
      night 'Flystyles' @ the Concorde. So good it was that I ducked out early from Fay's party to check it out later -
      when it was fuller and kicking. Get yourselves along for the next one.
    <p>
      The days since then have been spent attempting to get certain clubs and bars to promote themselves through
      <b>cBuzz</b>. Keep an eye out for all the latest info. on what's happening @ Hector's House. I've also been
      spending a lot of time in some of Brighton's finest cafes - as well as one that's not quite open. That one is Sub
      Cafe - a 24 hour cafe on the beach which has a kicking sound system and promises nights (and days) of DJ delights.
      Keep your eyes peeled to <b>cBuzz</b> for the news from them, opening real soon.
    <p>
      Took a morning out to see the press showing of Apollo XIII - the latest Tom Hanks film. What a corker - hard to
      describe as an enjoyable film as the created tension leaves little time to relax into the film - but I loved it.
      Possibly this one is a 'boys' film as it was us males that played with the space gear as kids (well my peer group
      was like that). Check it out for yourselves.
    <p>
      And finally....(for now, anyway) why not check out the Walmer Castle pub in Queens Park Road where I spent a most
      drunkenly enjoyable evening with the editor of Brighton's foremost (printed) fanzine (Handbook for the Recently
      Deceased) as well as our illustrious techno reviewers Curtis Child & 1016.
    <p>

      <a name=22sept>date: </a><b>22nd September 1995</b>
    <p>
      Well it's been such a busy time for me that a week has flown by without me scribbling some nonsense for this
      section of <b>cBuzz</b>. Anyone out there reading this could have a go at writing something for inclusion in this
      section that I'd really like to see develop as a kind of 'open access' area for debate and discussion or whatever.
      Get writing!
    <p>Talking of writing I'm on a little mission to get letters in the local newspaper "The Evening Argus" - I've
      possibly wrecked the concept now cos' if anyone at the Argus bothers to check out <b>cBuzz</b> they'll see this -
      well, anyway, the idea is to take hold of a local issue and write to the Argus in the style you know they love.
      I'm e-mailing them pretty regularly and got my first hit last week (Saturday, 16th September, picture letter).
    <p> So, <b>cBuzz</b> readers, if you don't tell anyone at Argus Towers then you too can play - just send a copy of
      your letters to me and I'll keep a tally of who's doing the best. If you really want to go for it full on then I
      suggest you use aliases and don't just use e-mail (yep, you'll need a stamp). You could always go down to the
      Sanctuary Cybercafe where they'll let you have a ten-minute session for a quid - you can e-mail loads of
      newspapers in that time as well as a couple of aliased letters to the Argus. Who knows we could actually generate
      some debate if we put our minds to it. And lets get creative on those pseudonyms!
    <p>
      My week has been dominated by this computer and running around desperately trying to get more and more info. for
      <b>cBuzz</b>; I'm getting a kinda system together and the future of this little venture looks exciting. I've
      hardly been partying - well, not at all - but like you I have to rest a little. Seriously I'd love to be out there
      but times demand diligence with the keyboard and the brain and the control of the finances.
    <p>Spent a bit of time at the <a HREF=http://www.pavilion.co.uk/access/cafe />Sanctuary Cybercafe</a> over the
      border in Hove and I recommend it as a must. Possibly one of my most favourite cafes in the domains of Brighton &
      Hove now has it's very own cybercafe - such idyllic bliss. I've sorted out an account on the computers and
      hopefully can do the same with the food and drink; regular updates on the goings-on will be provided here as I can
      see me spending a lot of time there (just a shame they're PCs - whoops, sorry the majority of you).
    <p>Flip side of the Sanctuary was that in checking out <b>cBuzz</b> not only did it seem really slow (despite their
      ISDN link) to pull from the server but the usage of colour on some pages makes the text hard to read. It's not a
      problem on my machine (I'm not that crazy) - just something resulting in trying to produce attractive pages for a
      variety of machines. Let me know if you've got any problems with any pages and what sort of set-up you're using
      (if you know or can be bothered, I'm not an expert on machine specs but I know some guys who are!)
    <p>
      Well, you can be sure to find more from me the next time you're here. I'm going to the Levellers @ the Brighton
      Centre on Saturday and a party on Sunday at a recording studio out of Brighton which I'll report back on next
      week. All the othertime I'm on the computer and may even get back to this page to recommend some weekend nights
      out.......but then I made that promise before (check back though - I never <em>promised</em>).
    <p>
      <a name=26sept>date: </a><b>26th September 1995</b>
    <p>Well, well, well! Once again another weekend has gone by without giving you merry internet surfers much info. as
      to what to do in Brighton. As soon as we get a better system, and the party's stop (do they?), we aim to provide a
      more thorough guide to sub-Brighton. In the meantime you'll going to have to make do with this rough and ready
      reckoner.
    <p>Last Friday I went to a reading by Milan Rai from his book on Noam Chomsky, at the Peace Centre. Chomsky is one
      of my heroes and the continuance and expansion of <b>cBuzz</b> will undoubtedly see some discussion on the
      writings of Chomsky. By the way any Chomsky fans will be interested in the
      <a HREF=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/tp0x/chomsky/contents.html>Chomsky archive.</a>
    <p>Friday night was spent on the computer. (checking out the Chomsky archive as well as working).
    <p>Saturday as well as working on the computer I awaited my Levellers tickets (or at least an e-mail telling me how
      to get them - but they never transpired, thanks Phil). In the afternoon I attended the launch party of the new
      Ugly Records shop in Sydney Street. The do was supported by a new alcoholic drink Gin-Zing, which is a mixture of
      Gin and 'natural high' components (ie Guarana, ginseng etc.), and plenty flowed. It's a really nice buzz - getting
      drunk and speedy at the same time. Try it- you'll like it.
    <p>Saturday night and as I couldn't be arsed to go out I spent more time on the computer to the accompainment of
      Radio 1 - nearly getting me out and about but then I remembered I had a party on Sunday.
    <p>Sunday lunch was spent @ The Green Dragon - wicked lunch cooked up by Chris before setting off inland to Ridge
      Farm. Ridge Farm is a recording studio owned and run by a friend of a friend Frank. Just recently the Brighton
      band Lobe have been recording their debut single there. It's a wonderful location and boasts an indoor swimming
      pool & jacuzzi complex as well as pretty great recording facilities (& a tennis court!). The party featured the
      Brighton Sound System Positive Sounds as well as Lobe playing later in the night. In the afternoon the swimming
      pool was well frequented by the junior contingent - aren't kids an important component of good parties these days
      - and in the evening a false floor was laid over the pool to provide a dance floor. And dance I did; kids are so
      uninhibited that you feel compelled to let go as they do - to dance like you used to in your bedroom behind closed
      doors.
    <p>And later I could be found in the jacuzzi. It's not the best time to discover the elastic's gone on your boxer
      shorts when you get out - but, hey!, that's rock n' roll. Back on to the dance floor and I eventually rolled home
      at 6am I think a thoroughly good time was had by one and all
    <p>Monday night and it's off to the Concorde to celebrate Ste's birthday. Ste is a brighton-based ('scouse) musician
      that used to be in a band called <b>Pan</b> that astounded the jazz dance tent audience at Glastonbury '94 when
      they must have been the last band to be playing on site, with a crowd of frenzied dancers, myself included! Tonite
      a good friend Ean was DJing, helping create another party night that has uplifted my spirits....stay tuned.
    <p>Quick plug for the opening of Brighton's first (correct me if I'm wrong - but I can't think of any others)
      24-hour cafe. Sub Cafe is in the arches on the seafront right by the Shark bar and have a real cool sounding sound
      system; with plenty of DJs lined up to spin some tunes. Check it out after it opens on Friday (29th Sept) - I will
      undoubtedly be down there often; collecting information for these pages, .....honest!
