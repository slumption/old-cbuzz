This third Batman film is by far the most spectacular, this time Val Kilmer (Willow, The Doors) stars as the Dark Knight/Bruce Wayne and Chris O'Donnell  (Circle of Friends) as his companion Dick Grayson/Robin. The Dynamic Duo are on a mission to destroy the evil 'Two Face' - Harvey Dent and 'The Riddler' - Edward Nygma (played  by Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey in their most bizarre roles yet). <p>

Along the way criminal psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) falls for both Wayne and Batman - their affair blossoms into the films very sexy love plot.<p>

All of the characters are quickly and effectively introduced and the motivations of 'the baddies' explained resulting in their wish to try and capture Batman and humiliate him in front of the Gotham City that loves him.<p>

The Riddler's brain draining televisions are a surprisingly harsh criticism of American TV culture. They enable him to sap the intelligence out of viewers with their IQs being zapped into his twisted brain. This makes him far more intelligent and far funnier to watch (look out for the bird bombs). Two Face is sinisterly and effectively played by Jones.<p>

The whole film flows as fast as the comic books (didn't the weeks drag then) and the opening sequences are enough to root your jaw firmly to your feet and to draw you into an anticipatory silence. My smarties remained unopened for a full twenty minutes while I regained my breath! <p>

This is a far saucier Batman than the previous two, gone is the gothic darkness of Tim Burton's directorship and here is a far faster and more credible superhero. There are plenty  of close-up shots and references to Batman's rubber suit; the audience even gets a chance to experience a tongue in cheek look at the caped crusader without him losing his mysticism and credibility.<p>

<b>Batman Forever</b> boasts having the largest audience ever for a film in the US and that looks set to be the case in the UK.<b> Batman Forever</b> doesn't fall into as many of the misogynist traps that I thought it would and instead it creates a powerful film which deserves the hype it has gained. Wait for the wonderful end sequence before you leave - you won't be disappointed. <font size=  -1 >(DJW)</font><p>
