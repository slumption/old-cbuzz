Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, The Mask) and Jeff Daniels (Speed, Arachnophobia) star as the two half-wits who now appear to be essential in creating a Hollywood blockbuster. The plot is predictably based around Carrey (Lloyd) and Daniels (Harry) unwittingly foiling a kidnapping.<p> 
The pair lose their jobs as limousine driver and dog groomer and decide to return the briefcase of Carrey's last customer, Mary (played by Lauren Holly), who is a dream woman to Lloyd.<p>
Unbeknown to the Pet crazed losers, the case was deliberately left by Mary for the kidnappers as it contains the ransom money that will free her husband!<p>
Consequently Lloyd and Harry travel from Los Angeles to Mary's home in Aspen by fur coated van, whilst being pursued by the kidnappers. What follows is a comic road-movie where the kidnappers keep their distance as they fear that Lloyd and Harry are FBI agents.<p>
On their arrival in Aspen the pennyless duo discover that the briefcase is full of money and rapidly spend it all; much to the annoyance of the kidnappers who eventually catch up with them.<p>
The gags can be seen from a mile off but many justify the ticket price. It's worth seeing for the scenes involving the abuse of various types of bird and associated bizarre facial expressions from Carrey.<p>
It's plain to see that Carrey is merely playing the same role as his previous two films - and as sequels to these are in the making we will clearly be seeing a lot more of him in the future.
<b>Dumb and Dumber</b> is fun now - but it won't be too long before Carrey's style is so over used and over exposed that it will soon become dated. See <b>Dumb and Dumber</b> now before this happens. (<font size=  -1 >DJW</font>)<p>
