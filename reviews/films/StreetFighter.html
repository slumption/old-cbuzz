Well, you've played the computer game throughout your teenage years and now
here's the film in much the same format. The same format, that is, except for
the addition of Jean Claude Van Damme (Time Cop, Kick Boxer), the late 
Raul Julia (The Addams Family, Presumed Innocent) and, of course, 
Kylie Minogue.<p> The film follows the computer game idea and has a constant 
and sometimes overpowering soundtrack and, as is to be expected, the odd
streetfight between all of your favourite characters.<p>

    The plot is simple M. Bison (Julia) is an evil psychopath who wants to
take over the world and Guile (Van Damme) is the Colonel of the AN
(Allied Nations - not United Nations - despite the same pale blue caps)
whose mission is to free the 63 hostages Bison has taken prisoner in order
to earn $20 billion in ransom demands. Simple.<p> Guile's efforts are aided by an
annoyingly overacted
                    reporter, Chun LI (Ming Na - Wen) and her news crew who
are (surprise, surprise) all <b>Street Fighter</b> computer game characters with
their own personal grudge against Bison.<p>

    Slowly but surely, all of the <b>Street Fighter</b> computer characters appear on screen and begin to, well, have street fights. The film is badly made, it is 
badly edited and the dialogue and sound effects are so badly combined that
much of the film is difficult to hear.<p> This, you might think, would make the 
essence of <b>Street Fighter</b> hard to follow, but this problem does not arise
as the film is so predictable, you know exactly what is going to happen from
the first minute of the movie.<p> The film offers all the sanitized hallmarks of the 
computer game - bloodless violence and murder as well as some dodgy stereotypes
of American xenophobia and dominance.

    However, it is going to be an enormous success and kids everywhere will
lap this up over the half term holidays. If it wasn't so badly made and acted
it would be astoundingly good fun, instead it merely is good fun.<p> The 
soundtrack features Ice Cube, LL Cool J and Public Enemy, so this should be
a huge hit too. Watch out for that last bit of advertising in the incredibly 
corny final shot and the stunning resemblance Bison's control room has to an
arcade machine. Implicit advertising ?-
 Never!
