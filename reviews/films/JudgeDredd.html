One cannot help to compare <b>Judge Dredd</b> to this summer's other smash hit <a HREF=BatmanForever.html>Batman Forever</a>. Both of them have a long history and cult followings of their own. That, unfortunately, is where the similarity between the two blockbusters ends. <b>Judge Dredd</b> is weak and almost incomprehensible in plot and dialogue is all too often sacrificed in favour of an inexplicable fight scene.<p>
<b>Judge Dredd</b>, played by Sylvester Stallone, is the most ruthless of the 'street judges'; lawwen of the future and in charge of the overcrowded 'Mega Cities', destined to fight crime in a pair of tights and some versace armour. This is a world of ruthless criminals and a corrupt government which ends up jailing <b>Judge Dredd</b> when he finds out too much about a secret project. In a bizarre parallel with Stallone's own life it transpires that <b>Judge Dredd</b> was in fact a product of a genetic experiment (with no good acting gene!) and an evil twin of the crime fighting hero had been created whose job was to wreak havoc in Mega City One.<p>
The special effects are well worth praise but could have been put to far better use to aid what little of the film could be classed as 'plot'. <b>Judge Dredd</b> isn't even good fun as it is too hard to relax and let the film develop in front of you. It is unclear in the beginning and unsatisfying at the end. <b>Judge Dredd</b> is definitely not as good fun as <a HREF=BatmanForever.html>Batman Forever</a> and doesn't exhibit the well rounded production techniques employed to make <a HREF=BatmanForever.html>Batman Forever</a> so special and worthy of being my number one choice this summer <font size=  -1 >(DJW)</font> <p>
