Right lets get this established from the start - this film is one of those sloppy Hollywood productions that all those smarmy, overpaid executives label `Cash Machine'.
A large (very large) number of people go & spend lots of money to watch this over-indulgent shite.Why?<p>
Still interested? Oh dear...  well here's the plot. Michelle Pfieffer plays country girl Sallyanne Atwater, who is desperate to work as a newscaster. She blags her way into a
Miami regional news station run by Warren Justice (played by Robert Redford).They hate each other, as she thinks she's going to the top but ends up making his coffee.<p>
Eventually they grow on each other as she is taught the business by him (can you guess what it is yet?). In the unbearably cliched Hollywood tradition it's an ending-by-numbers affair sa they fall in love,she works her way up & they marry. The pair go to prison riots & crises galore before she lands the top job,blah,blah,blah...<p>
If you've got any sense then you'll know what to do, but then again maybe you're into this kind of trash...<br>
