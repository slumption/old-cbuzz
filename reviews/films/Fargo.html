Based on a true story, Fargo is the tale of a kidnapping gone wrong, set in the desolate backwaters of Midwestern USA. The excellent casting places Steve Buscemi in the role of Carl, the more intelligent of the two psychopathic kidnappers.<p>
 Having starred as Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs, and more recently in Desperado and Things To Do In Denver When Your Dead, Bucemi has perfected his psycho-killer act, and is perhaps becoming type-cast. Nevertheless, he excels in this production, aided by his silent and altogether far nastier partner, Gaear, played by Peter Stormare.<p>
 The felons' paymaster is played by William H. Macy, (who also stars in the abysmal Mr Holland's Opus' and the TV series ER). His character sums up the stereotypical American loser - always failing, whilst constantly trying everything he can to succeed.
 They are pursued by Marge Gunderson, (played by Frances McDormand), who through her strange mannerisms eventually pulls the case together and gets her men.<p>
 The story is told often in the now familiar Tarantino-styled dark humour, occasionally incorporating the surrealism and rural atmosphere of Twin Peaks. This dark and very funny tale is well worth viewing if you enjoy Tarantino's (and his mimics') work.<p>
