<b>ID</b> is a very violent film about football hooliganism. It explores the 
possible 'other side' to this phenomena, by hinting that the yobs in the 
terraces are controlled by higher forces. Set in the late 1980's, this 
British made (and partly BBC funded) film follows John ( played by 
Reece Dinsdale of "Home to Roost" fame ), a 
young East End policeman who is
desperately searching for his big break into the higher echelons of the force.<p>This break comes when he, two other officers and a sergeant are sent undercover to expose the notorious 'Shadwell Dogs', an organised group of hooligans named after
 the fictitious team which they support. John fits into his character rather too well, much to the annoyance of his superiors, and soon finds himself loving his
new life and leaving his old one behind.<p>

    Dinsdale treads the very thin line between bad acting and credibility (there are only so many sunken eye stares an audience can take ) as John ends up looking like a deranged Michael Douglas. However, Dinsdale pulls the role off
quite effectively. If anything, the transition between nice John and nasty John
 happens rather too quickly. <b>ID</b> is  brilliantly directed and cut and the 
crowd scenes are excellently controlled and frighteningly realistic.<p> The film lays
heavy criticism on the role the police play at football matches and this may
overshadow the real poin of <b>ID</b>, that hooliganism IS wrong. In this capacity
<b>ID</b> also falls short of it's glorification of this problem - close
companionship amongst hooligans and the over the top male bonding is not 
sufficiently cancelled out by Johns' social demise and loss of sanity.<p>

    The audience  when I went was made up of short haired 20 year olds - no
surprise as the film is targetted at them. Alarming, however, is the 
fact that they were laughing and jeering at the scenes that were supposed to be shocking and horrific.<p>

    <b>ID</b> is very well made and has a brilliantly constructed and well thought out plot. However, the message it gives off isn't preaching to the converted
but merely amusing the partly guilty. This is a film that has been a long time coming but has fallen into the trap of romanticising this bloody, violent trend. <font size=  -1 >(djw)</font><p>
