Muriel (Toni Collette) is fed up with being told that she is ugly and useless, so she decides to leave her home in the Austrailian town of 'Porpoise Spit'
for a holiday of discovery. Whilst away she meets up with her bitchy 'friends'
and an old friend from her high school, Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths), who 
teaches Muriel to assert herself.<p>After exploiting her naive mothers chequebook, Muriel and Rhonda then set off for Sydney in search of fame and fortune.
Whilst there, Muriel fantasizes about meeting Mr. Right and systematically
visits every wedding outfitters to get polaroids of herself in various wedding 
dresses.<p>

      The plot then swerves in and out of various catastrophies to the sound of
ABBA's greatest hits and, if you are watching with a critical eye, you could
spot a hundred flaws and irrelevances which may leave some of the audience with
a bad taste in their mouths. The film does not quite pull off the sentimental
or 'meaningful' scenes and indeed, Muriels actual wedding is of little 
importance. However, <b>Muriel's Wedding</b> IS astoundingly good fun and well worth
a visit to the cinema.<p>

       My advice would be to definitely go and see <b>Muriel's Wedding</b> but to ignore the faults and just let it flow across the screen. Enjoy the wonderful
dance routines and watch out for the bean bag scene. <b>Muriel's Wedding</b> is continuing the recent trend of wonderful Australian films and deserves to be a huge success. I'm sure it will, very simple and excellent fun.<font size=  -1 >(DJW)</font><p>
