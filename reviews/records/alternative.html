<p>         Musical Talent will always shine through and it does on this double album from the Pumpkins. 28 (count 'em!) tracks on this CD and only 2 (maybe 3?) No-No's; then again nobody's perfect! The Pumpkins always manage to surprise the listener, whatever, and that's half the appeal.<p>From the sad, grand opening track on the album (Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness) to the limpness of <b>We Only Come Out at Night</b> and then to the spiky <b>Zero</b> - only a brave band could attempt this. And it reveals a unit closer than ever; knowing (give or take a tune or two) that when Corgan touches it it turns to gold.<p>And anyway anybody who cites Mr (Lizzy) Lynott as an influence on his music has my vote!<p>The downpoint - The Price! @ ï¿½17.99 to shell out the big Q is <b>is it worth it?</b> Well like most things in this bullshit we call life it's not what you like it's what you can afford. <br>Go like me and blag it!!<p>

              From the very first sonic cymbal to the screams of anger on the last track (<b>daddy</b>) of this album 
   i found myself listening intently to these guys problems, (only <b>shoots and ladders</b> had my mind wandering).<p> Korn are at the front of a new kind of sound with year  
 2000 firmly in mind. <b>Blind</b> the opening track (and currently doing the business stateside in the singles chart) is what Korn do best. Vocals which wrench at the listeners feelings, guitars trading insults and a bass 
sound that goes the distance with any dub tune.<p>
    <center>quite simply, a release on the edge, which is where we like it !!!</center>

Apparently dave grohl wrote and recorded this album on a four track while the other 99% of his time was occupied by nirvana. nirvana comparisons are obvious but also pointless and insulting.<p>
                 instantly hummable melodys over energetic and anthemic guitars, the energy and sincerity on <b>ill stick around</b>  irrelevance of <b>for all the cows</b>  or even the overcoming nausea and lump in throat of <b>exhausted</b> unite in the same way but different.<p>
                  sound like KURT C?
                maybe it does, but the results are just as good .<p>
                 <center>BUY IT, BLAG IT, AT LEAST LISTEN TO IT!</center>
