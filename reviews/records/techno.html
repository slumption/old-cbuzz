<p>Chicago 5-tracker with two tracks that make it worth getting. The first is <b>Buzz Buzz</b>, a brilliant track switching between 2 acid lines and then throwing them in together to fight it out. The second is <b>I'm a Freak</b>, a minimal Chicago track with the vocal line "I'm a freak, and your girl is too" - a definite must.<br>

I don't think this record can ever live up to the hype surrounding the <b>Red</b> series, all the music press are ready to shoot Dave down after the months they have spent hyping him up. <br>Right, just for a minute imagine <b>Red 1</b> and <b>2</b> never happened, you hear this record and it blows you away, you're not thinking "Oh but it's no different from 1 & 2", all you can think is how brilliant it is. The A-side is the kind of track that won't creep up behind you but will come up and hit you full in the face and force you to move. The B-side is the kind that will creep up behind you, kick you up the arse and scare you shitless. You'll either run out of the club screaming or be stuck on the dancefloor. <br>Everything that has got Dave where he is today is in here, the attention to detail, the excellent production and a sound that sticks out amongst the rest.
See the movie, read the book, stick the poster on your wall, but most of all buy this record.<p><HR  noshade width=60% size=2><p>

Four excellent tracks from the king of funky hardness, <b>Jeff Mills</b>. The first track has a filtered guitar sample that works perfectly, the second track is minimal bass and acid. It's the first track on side 2 that really stands out, all the Mills ingredients are here,  distorted loops, great drums, funky bass and EQ trickery. As for track two it's repetitive but definitely not boring.<br>
