Riptide Broadcasting, a newly formed radio company, will be delivering the first of a new genre of radio station, Swell FM, during July and August 1996 to Brighton and the surrounding area.<P>

Swell FM will be incorporating all styles of music programming as well as magazine shows, live band broadcasts, comedy and drama shorts<P>.

The musical content of Swell FM will be diverse with no boundaries. Dance through Indie through World music. Swell FM will be bringing the best of all alternatives, featuring both local and national DJ talent.<P>

Swell FM will be hosting a daily, locally-based magazine programme featuring a trio of invited guests reflecting the wide range of unrealised talent within Brighton. This programme will be broadcast live from Brighton's first ever 24-hour Sub Cafe; and an omnibus (edited highlights) version being broadcast at the weekend. <P>

Swell FM will provide a varied selection of spoken word output. As well as featuring news from the locally based SchNEWS team, Swell FM will include comic based shows, live comedy from local venues, and features from the Brighton based Community Radio Open Workshop (CROW).<P>  

Swell FM aims to deliver an advert-free radio service supported by sponsorship. The station's goal is to prove that good, alternative, locally-based and reflective radio can be achieved without the intrusion of consistent ad-breaks. As a supplementary, but equally important goal, Swell FM intends to adequately mirror the diverse and vibrant nature of  the town of Brighton.<P>

During its' on air period (15th July - 11th August) Swell FM will be incorporating into its' programming the covering of a number of vibrant local events:<P>

"Swell represents a new approach to the delivery of radio. We've seen radio tried in various guises locally and believe we can help breathe life into the medium on a local scale. A new licence for the town is due to be advertised shortly after we come off-air and we are trying to send a constructive message to whoever it is that secures that licence." commented Jerry Swift, station administrator.<P> 

He continues "Brighton contains such a variety of talents and any radio provider needs to fully integrate its' approach to this community to justify its' right to provide a service with respect to the Broadcasting (1990) Acts' objectives of  "broadening listener choice"</FONT><P>
