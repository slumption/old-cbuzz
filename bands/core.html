<A NAME="reviews"><HR WIDTH=40% SIZE=1></A><table border=2 cellpadding=4 ><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1>"Core are a phenomenon", sez their press release. Bold statements always guarantee feedback. The claim may be somewhat exagerrated, but it gets Brighton's Core the required attention. Led by the quite stunning vocals of Lee Malin, Core have a sound all their own - sort of melodic hardcore, but nothing familiar. And this is where they may come out on top. In a demo drawer positively swelling with repeated riffs and presumptous attitudes, Core's undeniable originality should be taken note of. Lee Malin - Mike Patton's little brother? A compliment not to be sniffed at.<p><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Metal Hammer</FONT></b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=1 rowspan=1>Harder than a brick in the face, Brighton bruisers Core are a mean bunch. Hardcore and Metal motifs abound, with 'Self-Centred Human' and 'Split Union' proving they also have a keen ear for melody. They won't be unsigned for long.<p><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Kerrang!</FONT> </b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1>By far the most powerful demo this month is CORE's s/t four track effort, which has a superb sound for a 'Live Studio' recording, and is a power-metal-groove-thang, with a vocalist who alternates between Mike Patton and Phil Anselmo modes - he sounds like two different people! 'Self Centred Human' shows they can write a good tune or two as well as just pouring on the riffs. This demo seems to have gotten them a lot of good feedback, too, as they've been gigging like basterds, including shows in Europe and the States.<p><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Terrorizer</FONT></b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=1 rowspan=1>An amazingly heavy sounding four-piece from Brighton with a host of minor triumphs to their name (2000 tapes and 300 T-shirts sold with no backing of any kind, big mailing list etc). They remind me of Faith No More before they went off the rails - similar vocal style and dynamics, but not so many obvious tunes. It's lively, exciting stuff, with a lot of energy running through it - if their stage act is as frenetic as the music implies, I can understand why they're such a hit locally. The fact that this tape was recorded live goes a long way to explaining its appeal. Although the sound gets a bit repetitive, with little variation between songs, it's good slam dancin' music if you're in the right frame of mind.<p><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Making Music</FONT></b></td></tr></table><p>
