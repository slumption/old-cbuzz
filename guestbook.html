What crap.
<BR>
Take it down: ugly, out of date (more than a YEAR!!!!), 
<BR>
cartoons of guys with hammers hitting themselves, 
<BR>
generally crap graphics.
<BR>
Makes Brighton's subcultures look really shit don't it?

Why don't you try to write about hiphop scenes in other parts of the world? For exapmle French, Croatian, German. I think that would be interesting for all the surfers that are visiting this site.
<BR>
I would be very grateful if you would consider this proposal.
<BR>
	THANX!</P>

<BR>They're doing some excellent Club nights at the moment, and why isn't 'Superfast Oz' mentioned.
<BR>As one of the most happening, and upcoming DJs in Brighton at the moment,

Paid a quick visit on the reccomendation of a friend. Looks interesting - esp. like the community bias.
