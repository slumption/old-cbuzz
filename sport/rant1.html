Well since coming to Brighton I've found loads of a cool routes and met loads of riders.Now as most of you all know Stanmer is the bollox for a quick blast or a days messing, but what is going on with the trail blockage.  <P>O.K. fair enough most of us get the message and don't ride those trails, as we can READ the signs.  Then comes along a certain few locals who are <B>''''COOL''''</B> so they say and they can ride the trails 'cos their doing so much good work for the enviroment.  <P>Until this stops the erosion and repair can't start.  so let me get this right, we can't ride these trail cos their under repair, but some elite few can, come on.  There are plenty of good trails that are still open.  <P>Anyway enough ranting.....<P><B>Shred of the week</B> is a quick woodland route.<P>Ride out to Stanmer park, and get to the top car park (nr the dual carriage way) via any good trail u can climb.  If its shitty use the road or you'll end up walking. Climb the gravel track that was part of the race course, at the top turn round.  You are now ready for your mystical journey.  Give it some welly all the way down, and now you face the decision, depending on cars you have to either slow down to follow the path or hop the car park bank if your brave, either way shred up the trail on the right.  Take the right (rooty) fork and then either descend down the parrallel rooty trail (race course start) or stick to the current trail.  At the (dippy, gravelly) corner go straight ahead, following the smoother line to the botton, and cross up over the jump. <P>Buzzin yet? Ride back towards Brighton, turn right up towards varley halls and then left, up the hill by the pub (all near the cross roads) climb to the hills top, turn right, then left, then right, then you should end up in  a cul-des-sac. Go up the chalk slope at the top of the estate and then climb the grass hill.  About half way up there will be two wooden posts, ignore the first and turn down the path marked by the second one, follow the trail correctly and youll end up coming down a steep slippy hill in wild park, mess up and you'll just come down to early.  Play on the banks and then chill out down on the sea front.  <P>This is the route I use when time is limited or I have break in my time table and need to return back to college later in the day.</FONT><HR width=90% size=4 ><p><center><A HREF="http://www.bton.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htimage/ras7/cbuzzmap.config">old.cbuzz.co.uk
