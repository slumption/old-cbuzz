O.k. What's new since the party? Well firstly the weather's been brilliant so I've been riding more than in the last few months.  It feels good to get back into it.  My latest discovery has come courtesy of Andrew 'Tids' Tidley.  Tids used to work in one of the local cycle shops and knows all the trails. The trail we rode last Monday was <b>Bitch.</b>The name describes how it rides, it's basically a trail down and then along the camber of the steepest hill in wild park.  If you go in the main entrance and then ride over to the left hand corner near the metal barrier there are some steps.  Shoulder your bike up to were the embedded planks start and then sort of weave up and left.  You'll no when you've found it because there's a fallen tree attached to a stump neaold.cbuzz.co.ukthe trail.  <p>
How to ride it.<P>
Well I'm not really the person to tell you how to ride bitch, I bottled it first go and second time down really messed up but then again so did Joe and Tiddler has practiced this hill alot.  The start is really off camber and if you brake you end up either tumble down hill or the wrong way round.  Ease of the brakes as you approach the two trees or you won't make the drop off.  As I discovered when I smacked into them and mashed my hip, elbow and thigh up still it was funny at the time.  Concur the drop off and it's almost dealt with.  Ease off the breaks and you'll be going a little to fast but you'll just about carve a turn into the corner.  Manage that and then it's flat out towards a tree at the bottom of the hill.  If you use the brakes you'll pull yourself down the camber towards the tree so stick with it but steer up the hill and you'll miss the tree, Just about!! Then slam on the anchors or you'll shoot down the grass hill onto the A23, nasty business.  <p>
A few wise words: 
<p>Bitch isn't a proper trail at the top so be considerate and don't mash the ground up to much.  I don't want this to sound like a 'me and my mates can ride it but you can't' statement.  I'm just want people to be carefully and not upset anyone in Wild Park because there is a lot of good riding and it's taken me a long time to get other people to share unknown route with me.
<p>Don't try it on your own or without a lid, if you do come a cropper like I did it's either funny and your just a bit sore or it's painful and a trip from the St. Johns is needed.
<p>Don't even think about doing it in the wet!!!
