This bike is fun to ride and is great on singletrack and d/h.  The uphills are a bit of a slog with that high stem and extra weight, but not to bad.  <P>For 900 quid less than the d/h version I would buy one.  Fit a flippable stem  and  better tyres and you have the almost perfect x/c and d/h bike.  By next year the frame will be lighter and well whats more important? weight or full suspension.  <P>If your in the market for a fast fun bike, that handles every thing well and want to be able to compete in all events look no further.  There are better bikes at this price, but there are worse as well.  For 1299 you could have a Team racing, thats light got any alu fram and Judys.  Or a Pro Racing with a funky thermoplastic frame for 1999.  I would pick the Team Racing for X/C as it is a perfect race bike for the price, but if money was no object I would but an LSD.<P>Downside: The tyres were too narrow for a full suspension bike, and the bike had a very upright stem.  To high for x/c not enough tire grip for d/h.  The brakes were fine but not upto the standards of V brakes.   If you fitted a flatter stem and shaved some weight off the bike it would be fine for x/c or fit V brakes and aggressive tires and have a class d/h bike.  <P></FONT><center><A HREF="http://www.bton.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htimage/ras7/cbuzzmap.config">
