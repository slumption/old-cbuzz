This was found by Joe accidentally whilst on a club ride.<p>
If you ride up towards the race course until you see the sign with 'race course' on it, and then ride through the course and down through the tunnel onto the common land behind the track there is a load of trails that are well ridden and some not so well ridden trails.<P>Anyway you can go up there next time you visit the track and make a day of it there's a load of trails just look for them.<p>To get to the Bevendean trail turn left out of the tunnel and ride along the edge of the course barrier till you reach a gate across the track.  Go through, cross both roads and then you'll be at a stables.  There's a good down the hill, but exercise some caution as there are people on it now and again and there's horse in the adjacent fields.  
<p>You'll end up going down some steps and then be at the end of a cul de sac. Go down the hill and left and then you'll be riding to what looks like a dead end.  Soon you'll see a kerb that leads onto a gravely track, after about ten to twenty yards (You'll know it's the start because its a steep grassy hill with a fallen tree at the top of it) hang a left over the log and then follow the trail almost straight on and take the right hand tracks if your faced with a choice of trails. You'll end up at a set of steps, ride down these or play on the slopes just passed them (not a good move in the wet as the run out is into some railings).
  <p>
You can jump some of the steps and then you'll be in Bevendean. Turn left and follow the road to the junction that joins the Lewes rd, opposite Brighton Uni, where now is your choice.
