Right listen up, I've noticed my ride guide getting bigger and there's a few thing's I need to point out.<p>
If an article is called new route, it's new route.  If it's called rant 'n' ride it's a new route and my points on what ever the latest gossip is.<p>
If my descriptions are a bit crap it's because I have to try and remember the trail, as soon as I get It together and take some good photo's this won't be a problem.<p>I assume when I write that riders who read this are  locals so if I talk of any places you don't know of you'll have to ask someone for some directions.  I know this is a bit crap, but this isn't intended to be a national ride guide, it's just places that are worth riding if your in the area so you may need a OS map of Brighton if you don't know it well.
<P>Please respect the routes I write about and don't <b>FUCK THEM UP</b> by locking your wheels up and trashing the trail or be clever and try to  knock people over.  It has taken me a year and a half of riding with a lot of good local riders to gain their trust and be shown some of these trails and others are my own discovery.  Don't mess things up, I'm not saying only "me and my mates" can ride here, I'm just saying a lot of these routes are on land that could easily be put out of limits to us through a moments stupidity.<p>
I really would like some help and input for these pages, writing routes takes ages and Iï¿½m sure you can give me some good info for these pages.  <p>The feel free to E-mail me <A HREF=MAILTO:mtb@cbuzz.demon.co.uk>cBuzz</A> with you ideas, links etc.<P>
I am trying to get some more things to test so watch these pages.<p>
Finally if you hurt yourself, it's not my fault I may have told you about some good routes but I'm not taking any responsibility if you attempt something you can't do.  Mountain biking is a dangerous sport and the way I progressed was by pushing my limits enough so I may have the odd stack but I always knew my capabilities.  I'm still struggling with Bitch, I'll have it dialed soon.  Good Luck!<p>If there's enough interest I would like to orgnaise some form of informal ride each week, if your interested phone me on (01273)684360 and ask for Paul or mail me.<p>
