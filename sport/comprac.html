This was the only rigid bike Scott gave us to test.  Full cromo frame and forks made fro Scotts new ultra light tubing. LX/XT components.  Avid levers, mavic 221 rims and ritchey tires.  Light frame and wheels, overall good x/c bike.  The Scott bars were to narrow and messed the handling up.  Overall it was a really good x/c bike and I wouldn't feel uncomfy racing it.  For the price of a par of Judys and new bars you could have a Team Racing with Judys and an Alu frame.<P>Overall: The Scott comp racing was the best bike on test for x/c.  A Light bike good component spec.  The wheels and groupset were excllent and we had no problems with them.  <P>Down side: The scott vertigo LSD was a good all rounder but needed the stem and tires changing it also needs wider bars. </FONT><P><center><A HREF="http://www.bton.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htimage/ras7/cbuzzmap.config">old.cbuzz.co.uk
