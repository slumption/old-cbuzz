<h3>About Bone Idol.</h3><p>
<font size=  +1 >
Bone Idol was set up in 1994, and the Bone Idol shop is situated near the 
West pier pictured below.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/WestPier.jpg" border=0 width=300 height=200></center>
<P>
The shop has just undergone an extensive refit which coincides with the release of the third summer catalogue.  Copies will be available from the shop as well as all of the clothing and accesories in it.<p>
The Bone Idol label is stocked by more and more shops each year and the mail order side of the business is booming.  Any of the products shown in the catalogue are availble by mail order from the address below, to receive a special discount quote cbuzz in the order.  We don't intend to use an e-mail ordering system where you send any bank or credit card details.  We feel it is still insecure on the Internet however, if you place your order by post with  a cheque to us your goods will be dispatched A.S.A.P.<p>
Were also sponsoring several local surfers and skaters and their progress will be covered on the site as well as the local seen on the south coast.
<p>

<h3>How to get there.</h3>
<p>

From Hove follow the Kings road to the West pier (the damaged one) and find somewhere to park, there is an NCP opposite the roller blade hire shop.<p>From London follow the A27 in to Brighton and then head for the seafront and then turn right at the Palace pier and park in the NCP opposite the West pier.<p>Find some steps or a ramp onto the sea front and were situeated in between Gemini's beach bar and the West Pier.<p>
See you soon!<p>
