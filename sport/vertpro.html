Our testers found it fun to ride, smooth and fast on downhills, and it inspired the rider with its predictable, neutrale handling to push it more.  The bike had the new V brakes, which every one liked.  They clogg less than cantis and have more power than disk....spot on..The Scott pedals were unavailble at the time of the test but we are told they are like SPD's and Onza's.Adam was the main tester of this bike as he had to ride it to Stanmer and then claimed that he had been goaded into sillyness by the bike!!!!!!This is apparent from the photos.The bike has heavy, but bombproof wheels, Mavic 121cd rims are their new d/hill offerings.  <P>Downside: Fitting spikes as the tires was the only fault really found with the bike, they were fine on the day as it was muddy but we would pick magics or something similar.The bike did clog up in the mud but so did everyone elses, however there are a lot of fiddly bits to clean.  The seatpost and stem seems a slight downgrade for a bike of this price.  old.cbuzz.co.uk
<P>Good points: Every one liked the new Rapid fire plus.   The bike had 100mm of travel at the back from a sealed fox shock and Judy DH's upfront.  <P>Overall we liked this bike it's fun and would be a great bike for pure downhillers which is who it's aimed at.  With a change of tires you could compete in Europe at the Grundigs and not feel let down by the bike.<P></FONT><center><A HREF="http://www.bton.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htimage/ras7/cbuzzmap.config">
