<em>...these people are not human and need to be brought to justice."</em><br>
<strong>- Kura Njie, cousin of Ibrahima Sey</strong>

<P>Family members and campaigners have called for the withdrawal of CS
Spray from all police forces following the killing of Ibrahima Sey in
police custody last year. They are also demanding the prosecution of
the police officers involved in his death after an inquest jury
returned a verdict of unlawful killing last Thursday (2nd).
<P>
Mr. Sey, a 29 year-old Gambian asylum seeker and former international
football player, died in the early hours of 16th March 96. He had been
sprayed with CS gas and `restrained' by several officers whilst
handcuffed within the custody suite of Ilford police
Station. Mr. Sey's window Amie Sey believes her husband was murdered
by the police and condemned the way in which they sought to cover up
an incident which has left her two children fatherless. In a statement
on behalf of the family Kura Njie, said "We have endured the worse
eighteen months of our lives waiting for the truth to emerge and to
hear the exact circumstances of Ibrahima's death. It is an outrage and
a crime that he was treated so brutally by those who claim to defend
the public."
<P>
Mr. Sey's death came just two weeks into the six-month long trial of
the sprays by selected forces across the country. Despite his death
Michael Howard declared the trails a complete success - which of
course it was, if your aim is to help the police kill off as many
`suspects' as possible.
<P>
The official cause of death was `positional asphyxia' but this does
not reveal the true story. Mr Sey was arrested by seven officers from
Forest Gate, taken to nearby Ilford police station with his friend Pa
Ebou Ndimbalam, where he was handcuffed, placed in a "restraining"
hold and then had so much gas solvent sprayed in his face that it was
literally dripping from his mouth and led him to begin swallowing the
solution. When he collapsed he was left laying face down on the
custody room floor with the police standing around, one copper even
swapping over the handcuffs so that he would not have to do any
overtime once they realised something was wrong.
<P>
The verdict of unlawful killing follows an eighteen month justice
campaign organised by the Newham Monitoring Project (NMP) an
anti-racist community organisation that campaigns against racist
attacks and police harassment,. Within days of the death the campaign
had organised a public meeting, a three hundred strong picket of the
police station and an angry march of over one thousand people between
Forest Gate and Ilford Police Stations.
<P>
The family and supporters who had packed the gallery throughout the
five week long inquest had been particularly angered by the testimony
of the police. The WPC who had actually sprayed Mr. Sey sought
sympathy from the jury by explaining how horrible it was to have
members of the local community calling you a murder and that the
stress of it all had given her "terrible acne." Family friend Pa Ebou
Ndimbalam was left waiting in the police station for four hours
thinking Mr. Sey was in the cells when he was actually lying dead in
hospital. Even then they insisted on interviewing him (which they had
no legal right to do) before telling him of Mr. Sey's death. Evidence
of the cause of death was clouded by the fact that the CCTV cameras in
the station were "not working" at the time. The police doctors first
claimed that he had died of "heart disease" but they subsequently
changed it to "excited delirium" a term used in the Victorian era
meaning that your mental equilibrium is disturbed and you get so
worked up that you literally drop dead!
<P>
Chair of the NMP Barry Mussenden, told SchNEWS "It is ridiculous to
see the way in which the increasing numbers of black people dying in
police custody are being consistently ignored. When the police were
issued with American style long handled batons in 1995 we predicted
another Rodney King style case and within a month Brian Douglas died
from a blow to the head. We made with same prediction with CS Spray
and this time it only took two weeks. As far as we are concerned the
police are the real criminals and they should be disarmed."

<UL> 
<LI>Following NMP's Ibrahima Sey memorial Campaign the
organisation were accused by the police of using public money to fund
political activities. Predictably the council responded by cutting
their grant.  The NMP are now helping another black family where
father, mother and four month old baby were all sprayed with CS gas by
Forest Gate Police. Contact Newham Monitoring Project, PO Box 273,
Forest Gate, London E7 0181 555 8151.

<h2><A NAME="crap">U.S. Crap Arrests of the Week</h2>

For carrying signs and chanting slogans, singing songs and taking
photographs. On the morning of July 7th, 29 American Earth First!ers
were nicked in Wisconsin, while protesting against the proposed Wolf
River Exxon/Rio Algom Corp. metallic sulphide mine. Protesters were
charged with"Unlawful Assembly" and "Criminal Trespass."
<P>
Once in handcuffs, people were bussed hundreds of miles to six
different jails in six counties. Some were placed in solitary
confinement, others were denied access to telephones or water. None
were allowed to speak to a lawyer. Bail hearings did not come for two
days after the arrests and bail was set between $350 and $500.
<P>
Exxon and other mining corporations have successfully biased the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, influenced the State
Legislature, dismantled environmental watchdogs, interfered in local
politics, disrupted Indian communities and spent millions of dollars
on a public relations blitz with TV, print and radio ads. All to make
a quick buck extracting mineral wealth which has lain untouched for
millennia - minerals such as like copper, gold, uranium, zinc, lead,
mercury, arsenic, chromium and sulphides.
<P>
The resistance to metallic sulphide mining in Wisconsin has been
extensive, especially because of its effect on locally produced foods,
such as soybeans, cranberries, ginseng, maple sugars, potatoes and
more is shipped out around the world, and Lake Superior is home to 20%
of the world's freshwater reserves.

<h2><A NAME="oil">100 DAYS OF OIL ACTION</h2> 
On Weds. 8th October several UK EF!  activists erected banners outside
the Oxford homes of Directors of BP and Texaco Ltd. They also handed
out leaflets reading "Severe Weather Warning" documenting the causes
and problems of global warming, and promoted sustainable energy
resources as an alternative to oil. A recent central London oil
conference was also disrupted in the run up to the Kyoto Climate
Change conference.  One activist dressed as an "oil bride" threw
herself at John Battle MP, Minister of State for Energy, to symbolise
the intimate relationship between this government and the oil
industry.

<h2><A NAME="bankers">Bunch of Bankers</h2>
The Kebele not-for-profit squatted community centre in Bristol has been served its eviction orders. On September 23 ownership of the building 
passed from the Bristol One Parent Project to Lloyds Bank. John from Kebele told SchNEWS "Despite attempts to negotiate a future for the 
building as a housing co-op with them, Lloyds intend to auction the property, which is worth very little and will almost certainly stand empty until 
it is knocked down and replaced with something cheap, ugy and profitable. Several other houses on Robertson Road are already empty and 
bricked up after squatters were evicted earlier this year." He added "There is strong support within the inner city community of Easton for 
Kebele. We firmly believe that it is time to put people before profit, to continue demonstrating that an anarchic existence can be achieved in this 
`society'." If you want to help resist the eviction, contact (0117) 9399469.

<h2><A NAME="genetix">Supertrees</h2>

Last week the Labour Party delegates were surprised to see half a
dozen mutant veggies, including a radish, marrow and a beef tomato
with horns dishing out the dirt about genetics. Meanwhile as part of
the Global Days of Action against genetic engineering people stripped
off on the roof of Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) - the advertising agency
trying to paint a rosy picture of nasty mutant soya bean makers
Monsanto. They asked for the bare facts to be disclosed and called for
an end to `the genetics cover up'. Please don't ring BBH on 0171 734
1677 and make deformed gestures down the phone.  Monsanto are also
involved in a joint venture with ForBio who have developed supertrees
that grow faster, straighter and larger than their conventional
counterparts which can be handled by a three-armed robot which will be
able to produce 750 embryonic trees an hour. Three of the robot
assembly lines can generate millions of genetically modified seedlings
a year. The elite seedlings will sell for up to ten times the price of
conventional seedlings.

<h2><A NAME="brief">SchNEWS in Brief</h2>
<UL>

<LI>Hague may look uncannily like a foetus, but what if our leaders
took the lead of some Brazilian politicians? You may remember SchNEWS
telling you that a goat called Smelly was elected to the city council
of Pernambuco in 1954, but did you know that just 5 years later a
female rhino was elected to serve on the municipal council in Sao
Paolo...by 50,000 votes. It's true. Honest.

<LI>Texaco pulls out of Burma! the US oil giant announced that they
were to sell their stake in a natural gas project off Burma's coast in
a major coup for the Burmese democracy movement and supporters
worldwide. This follows Clinton's decison to bar new investment in the
military-ruled Burma.  Multinational oil company investment in Burma
provides the largest legal source of foreign currency to the regime

<LI>Success in the Lancashire hills as North West Water back down over
plans to build a theme park in Lever Park, which was given to the
people in 1902 to be free for all time, after a campaign by locals and
Green Party activists. They are now attempting to negotiate with the
Action Group, who are trying to buy (or get for free) NWW's stake.

<LI>There are plans to develop what will be Europe's largest indoor
Ski Centre next to Pennington Flash near Wigan, a site of special
biological interest. The domed building will be 230ft high, with space
for 3000 cars. There will be the usual shops, cinema, an aquatic
centre and the Snow Centre which will produce real artificial snow
burning 2050 cubic metres of gas every hour to fuel the
refrigerator. Wigan Borough Council (01942 44991), who own the site
and are pushing it through

<LI>The FBI and NSA are lobbying for a 5 year prison sentence for any
American that uses encryption on the Internet that the US security
services can't read. If they suceed it is expected that governments
worldwide will follow suit!

<LI>The Earth First! periodical Do or Die has dropped the letter `e'
from its name in honour of Lady D

<LI>Huntingdon Life Sciences, the company at "the leading edge of
biological research", and currently subject to an animal rights
encampment outside its premises, is looking for a new Marketing
Officer.  Interested? Then send a CV with a covering letter to The
Personnel Officer, Huntingdon Life Sciences, PO Box No 2, Huntingdon,
Cambridgeshire, PE18 6ES. Closing date 20th October. Go on, it could
even keep the Welfare to Work officials off your back.

<LI>Eat yer mash and save water - is the latest advice from a Cornall
University researcher who has been calculating the amounts of water
needed to produce the world's staple foods. More than 1900 litres of
water are needed to grow a kilo of rice, whereas the same amount of
potatoes only need 500 litres of water. This pales into insignificance
when you compare how much water is needed to make a kilo of beef -
100,000 litres!

<LI>The Rollright Stone circle is safe! Last month saw the Rollright
Stones Appeal bid for the site, but were pipped to the post by Nat Le
Roux and Nick Cavalla, two city types. They have, however, decided to
set up a charitable trust (very handy for tax purposes!) to preserve
the Neolithic site, with the backing of The Rollright Appeal. Details:

<LI>Westminster Council (0171 828 8070) is considering `housing' up to
210 asylum seekers in a floating hotel formerly used by oil workers.

<LI>The Environment Agency have been lobbing multi coloured cucumbers
into the Irish sea...in order to find out why sheep shit keeps
floating ashore Blackpool beach. Apparently cucumbers float under the
surface of the water and are driven by tidal flow, rather than by the
wind.

<LI>The spoilsport government of the Northern Italian state of Como
have written to managers urging them to ban morning coffee breaks for
their workers in a bid for a more efficient workforce. The letter
states, "...to drink a coffee during work hours is a flagrant
violation of office duties." SchNEWS say, "....to drink a coffee
during work hours is the only way we get anything done!"

<LI>On or around 14 Sep, the fences around Greenham Common were
snipped back and pulled down, five years after the last nuclear
missiles were withdrawn form the base. The area will now revert to
common land, although some areas will be off limits for safety
reasons.  Local MP David `hypocrite' Rendel claimed credit for the
Greenham women by telling ITN, "We've now finally got it back. It's no
less than our due and we are going to make good use of it."  SchNEWS
asks what about the land being trashed by his beloved Newbury Bypass,
couldn't that be better used?

<LI>A discarded cigarette was the probable cause of the fire which
destroyed the luxury home of the president of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco in
Wilmington, North Carolina.

<LI>More than 200 Taiwanese anti-nuclear activists braved rough seas
in 106 fishing vessels to stage a mass blockade in protest against a
planned nuclear power station. The $4 billion American project
