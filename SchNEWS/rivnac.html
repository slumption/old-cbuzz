The 4-5 hectares of land includeswhite sandy beaches looking onto a lagoon and over 160 trees, somewhich are now endangered in Tahiti.<p>Since 1991 Tahitians have been opposing the Rivnac hoteldevelopment. This has involved thousands of people from the localcommunity participating in protest marches and people squatting onthe land itself. In late January the Tahitians trying to protectthis archaeological site were evicted. Since then excavations havecommenced, the land is fenced off for access by the localpopulation, and a heavy policy presence, at times numbering 300gendarmes are at the site itself.<p><UL><LI>The land is a valuable archaeological site, it is a pre-European  burial  ground. This has been confirmed by a scientific survey    and a paper from  the prosecutor.<LI>There has been no independent environmental and no socio-economic survey  conducted before construction. A company called "Speed"   which is wholly  owned by the developers conducted a survey.<LI>The site is a residential area, and is not suitable for a 8 story hotel  with 350 rooms and 12 over-water bungalows.<LI>The indigenous owners of the land still dispute the local         government  claim to the land. The local government has rented    the land to the "Society Hoteliere Rivnac" to develop the hotel.  The company is a subsidiary of the French multi-national          corporation "Lyonnaise Des Eaux" and "Dumez"</UL><p>A number of legal actions are still pending against thedevelopment:<UL><LI><LI> In 1993 a legal action was introduced to the Committee on Human  Rights  in Geneva for violations of the international pact on  civil and political  rights. This international agreement is  signed by France.<LI> The association of local residents "Ia Ora Nu'uroa" opposed to  the development and filed a lawsuit in the "Conseil D'Etat" in  Paris related to the public road, which has been changed into a   private road for the developers. The action is still pending. <LI> A criminal case is also pending in which the promoters have been  accused of corruption. It is alleged that the financing of the  project came from tax-exempt money from France.</UL><p>The hotel is to be managed by the "Meridien" chain which was ownedby the Forte hotel group. On January 24 1996 this group was takenover by Granada Group plc.<BR><STRONG>Every day the developers are excavating the land further andcausing further destruction. Every day and every action counts tostop the development. We ask you to take  the following action assoon as possible.</STRONG><BR> Faxes are preferable, due of lack of time, butwritten letters will also do.<BR><EM> Please do not forget to sign and putyour name and address on the letters/faxes you send.</EM><P><H4>1.

Demon-strations are still occurring at the site and are planned tocontinue well into the future.This does not encourage tourism inthe area, neither does the heavy police presence.<BR>The history of this development will make marketing of the hotelvery difficult, especially when it becomes known that:<BR>-the hotel is to be sited on a valuable archaeological site, which is a pre-European burial ground.<BR>-over 160 very old trees, some now endangered in Tahiti are on the site.<BR>-there has been no independent environmental and/or socio-economic survey  conducted.<BR>-the site is in a residential area.<BR>-the indigenous owners of the land still dispute the local government claim to the land.<BR>-and the various pending legal actions and opposition.<BR>Granada's association with the Rivnac development and itscorruption scandals is damaging to your image in Europe andabroad, and therefore we urge you to withdraw your involvement viathe "Meridien' hotel group with this development.<BR>Looking forward to a reply with your position.<BR>Yours Sincerely<BR><H3>2.

Your contact stipulates managing andmarketing of the hotel.<BR>It is in your interest to pull out of the contract and to stop theproject proceeding, as your involvement in a project which facescorruption charges, damages your own reputation and image.<BR>Since 1991 Tahitians have been opposing the development.Demonstrations are still occurring at the site and are planned tocontinue well into the future, including when you will be managingand marketing the hotel. There have already been and will befrequent marches against the development, which will also resultin a police presence being necessary to manage the hotel itself.This does not sound like an attractive marketing proposition.<BR>I would like to know whether "Meridien" frequently participates inmarketing and managing hotels where planning regulations are notadhered to, as no independent environmental or socio-economicstudies have been conducted prior to the development starting. Thesite is a valuable archaeological site as recognised in the UnitedNations Committee on Human Rights in Geneva and the developmentwill also cut down more than 160 very old trees, some of which arenow endangered in Tahiti. Also the area is a residential area.<BR>I support the local and growing international opposition to thedevelopment of the Rivnac/Meridien hotel and draw your attentionto the pending court cases against this development, being:<BR>-a legal action introduced in 1993 to the Committee on Human Rights in  Geneva for violations of the international pact on civil and political  rights.
