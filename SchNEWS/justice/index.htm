<H1>About Justice?</H1>
<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->

<STRONG>Justice?</STRONG> - the people who squatted the Courthouse and
brought you the Squatter's Estate Agency. The collective who've been
arrested more times than they've had hot dinners. It's an identity for
a collective of people who are disgusted by things like the powers of
the state and the destruction of the environment; it's a resource to make
things better. It's <em>not</em> a clique. Nobody is a "member", you
won't be given a membership form to fill in, and nobody tells you what
to do. Well, they do, but when they've finished ranting, we ignore
them anyway. There aren't any leaders.
<P>
