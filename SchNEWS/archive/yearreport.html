"Fancy a bite to eat? We won't have a burger, there's a McLibel demo outside the shop. We certainly won't buy veal - RIP Jill Phipps. Can't really go for a spin, since we are boycotting petrol stations and motorway extensions. People are living in trees at the end of the road. Head for a train, past the patchwork of travellers buses and trucks parked up on wasteground by the station. Give them a wave. Have a laugh at the slogans on the defaced billboards. Catch sight of a TV shop showing the news of the Home Secretary's house being invaded by the homeless. Britain's changing. Great isn't it?"<br>

The government's legislation backfired spectacularly as people around the country took the opportunity to have a good time and  make a political statement.......<p>

<font size=  +1 >3.11.94 </font> <b>Preparing for defiance</b> as the CJB gained Royal Assent to become the new-born Criminal Justice Act. WHAAAAAAA!<br>
 <font size=  +1 > 4.11.94</font>  <b>Up a crane in Manchester</b> - within 24 hours of the Act becoming law, four people - Ollie, Pete, Chris and Paul - were the first people in the country to be arrested for 'aggravated trespass' on the No M65 campaign. <b>On the roofs of Parliament</b>, later that day, five activists climbed on to the roofs of Westminster Hall at the Houses of Parliament and sat silhoutted against Big Ben with a 'DEFY THE CJA' banner for all the world to see. Could've kissed 'em!<br>
<font size=  +1 >11.11.94</font> <b> On the roof of the squatted Courthouse</b>, a community centre in Brighton, to resist the eviction. Birthplace of a million dreams... <br>
<font size=  +1 >20.11.94</font> <b> In Michael Howard's backgarden</b>, Folkestone, when 400 people put the Home Secretary and the Government on trial and found them Very Guilty Indeed. While in Essex, police made a mass arrest of 31 hunt sabs in an operation costing �40,000 and marred by allegations of serious assault, including one woman who was beaten semi-conscious with a truncheon while she had her hands cuffed behind her back.<br>
<font size=  +1 >27.11.94</font> <b> On the top of the 'Dolly', a 100ft tower  on a doomed squat in Claremont Rd</b>, East London, at the start of the Britain's longest post war eviction.

<font size=  +1 >17.12.94</font>  <b>At a Crookesmoor  Middle School in Sheffield</b> where 300 activists held a manic DiY conference to plan the New Year of protest after squatting the empty building - and then tatted a Port-a-loo to stink out the visting namesake and then Employment Secretary, Michael. <p>

  <font size=  +1 >27.1.95</font>  <b>On top of a lorry in Brightlingsea</b>, Essex, as the live animal trade moved into the tiny community of 8,000 and the police waded into protestors....<br>

"The Act is, quite simply, a mess. Most police forces have been vary wary of using it, as it is so badly put together it's impossible to put it into practice. The blame for this shambles must be laid firmly at the door of the Home Secretary who introduced the act for the sake of a few cheap cheers at party conference. We anticipate there will be more acquittals, more charges dropped, and that those police forces who seek to use the act in an aggressive way such as Kent and Northamptonshire will be facing a hefty bill for damages with precious little to show in the way of convictions."<br>

In the year since the Criminal Justice Act became law over 500 people have been arrested but not a single one jailed (until today?). In fact, around 90% of cases have been dropped or, when they have gone to trial, defendants are acquitted. <br>Many police forces have been wary of testing a poorly-drafted piece of legislation and have opted for a more widespread use of the 1986 Public Order Act - making over 1,200 arrests at live animal export demonstrations alone in the last 12 months. <br>However, the CJA has been used countless times as intimidation. Peaceful protest has, however, been effectively banned by the use of outrageous bail conditions. It seems not to matter whether charges will stand up if the police can bar someone from protest sites until trial. The immobilised protestor then faces up to six months wait when the ludicrous charges are then dropped and no trial takes place and people are acquitted.<br> Many people are now suing the police for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.These figures are as accurate as we can get them. The indication they give is that the police are acting as political servants of the govenment and their vested interests. It also shows clearly that the Criminal Justice Act simply is not working.<p>
<b>* Since the riot at Hyde Park last year, when the media first woke up to the CJA, protestors have gone from fighting in the streets to fighting in the courts - and winning time after time:</b><p>

<b>31.8.95 </b> Travellers in Crowborough, East Sussex successfully challenged an eviction order under Section 77 of the CJA when Judge Sedley announced the law was 'Draconian' and 'unlawful' on the grounds that Councils have a legal duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need under the Children's Act.<br>
<b>13.9.95  </b> A Druid, King Arthur Pendragon, beat down Babylon in the first test-case of Section 71 of the CJA'trespassory assemblies' (where gatherings of more than 20 people are declared illegal by decree from Chief Constables). Back then his annual celebration at Stonehenge was stopped by the boys in blue - but now Excalibur has cut another swathe from the Government's field of Law Und Ordnung.<br>
<b>28.9.95	</b> Already condemned by the United Nations, Part I of the CJA - the building of children's prisons for 12-14 year olds - was taken to the High Court by the Howard Leaugue for Penal Reform who extracted major concesions from the Home Office. Local Authories in three of five cases have refused planning permission and anything to do with them. Not a brick has yet been built.<br>
<b>2.11.95</b>  Black Moon Soundsystem had their �9,000 rig confiscated in July but have had their rave test-case adjourned again - for the seventh  time. Are the powers-that-be scared or do the police just wanna have a party? We should be told.<p> 

<HR width=75% size=3><p>
<b>The Criminal Justice Act is a poorly-drafted hotch-potch of prejudicies created by a paranoid and psychotic government. It is about protecting vested interests, playing on the fear of the general population, aided and abetted by a tame and unquestioning mainstream media. <br>It is about freedom - freedom to make profit, freedom to build roads without people interfering, freedom to siphon people into pubs and clubs instead of churches and fields. That's why it is heavily sponsored by the Tory Party.<br> Its 172 sections consitute an extremely wide-ranging set of police and judiciary powers to deal with  everything from combatting terrorist actions to raising the fines for dreging shellfish, from the recognition of the offence of male rape to reducing the number of travellers' vehicles allowed to park up on a piece of land. <br>That's why, because of the inclusive breadth of the Act, Labour got away with abstaining on it. And in a final great Catch-22, protest against the Criminal Justice Act is prohibited by the Criminal Justice Act.<p>
</b>
"Everything is inverted. The Criminal Justice Act makes dancing a crime. But beating people over the head in order to break up a festival is called 'public order'. Travelling is a crime. But trashing someone's home, taking their vehicle and then destroying it, forcing children into care and parents into prison, this is called justice. Wanting a roof over your head is a crime. But vigilantes with pickaxe handles smashing their way through your front door and laying waste to all your possessions is called 'property rights'. Something is fundamentally wrong here."<br>
<b>C J Stone, United You're Nicked
</b>
<p>
"The Criminal Justice Act 'is not working'. The cornerstone of the government's law and order policy is 'unworkable' after a first year marred by court defeats, confusion and allegations of misuse."<br>
<b>Front Page headline, The Independent 28.9.95</b><p>

"Right now you may be living through the failure of your government to impose social control on the lifestyle of your generation. Since the Criminal Justice Act became law it has consistently proved to be one of the most unpopular pieces of legislation in recent history; misunderstood by the police, denounced by High Court judges .. it is now descending to the level of farce. The CJA is sick. Happy First birthday - you might not be around for a second one."<br>
<b>Jonny Davies, The Face
</b><p>

"If footy fans are repeatedly stopped and searched then eventually they're going to react. It's ludicrous to use this provision on them. The Act says that if you'shout and gesture within sight or hearing of a person that's likely to be distressed' then it's a criminal offence. But that's what football fans do. So you might as well arrest the whole ground."<br>
<b>Mike Slocombe, Football Fans Against the CJA</b><p>

"When the government passed the CJA I am not entirely sure they were aware of what an enormous favour they were doing the underground free party scene. Put simply, the CJA has sorted out free parties in this country - BIG TIME! Every single weekend without fail since the enstatement of the Act, a huge party has gone on without interruption from the law - sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes seven soundsystems .... It seems as though the CJA was just the kick up the arse that the scene needed."<br>
<b>DJ Weasel, United SoundSystems</b><p>

"We've been doing parties all year, both here and elsewhere, and the CJA hasn't been used to stop us at all. On one occasion when we were moving gear into a disused shop two passing police women came in to investigate what was going on. They simply couldn't believe that we were going to all this trouble to put on a party for free .. that we wanted to get together with our friends and acquintances, play music, dance and have fun! But the sinister part of the legislation is that it can be down to the whim of an individual police inspector and the wordings of the CJA leave room for very loose interpretation."<br>
<b>Markus, InnerField SoundSystem</b><p>

"As a young faggot I'm supposed to be proud of the age of consent reduction from 21 to 18 for us men loving men. I'm meant to rejoice at the kindness and tolerance of the State [who are] hoping to divide up anger by rewarding some and scapegoating others. But I'm not going to be a gay sell-out."<br>
<b>Anon, Passion Brigade (formerly Lesbian and Gay Freedom Movement)</b><p>

"Where the CJA has really bitten hard is the free festival movement and the travellers. There's been a mass exodus to Spain and Ireland, where there is less harrassment. Without a strong travelling community, it's impossible to have a viable free festival network."<br>
<b>Michelle Poole, Advance Party</b><p>

"These laws effectively make our way of life illegal because there is nowhere in the country we can legally camp...even if we are given permission to camp, the landowners can be prosecuted for breach of planning permission. This applies even if we buy our own land. We have no alternative but to camp wherever we can find disused land. I would advise anyone charged under the CJA to fight all the way. Win or lose you can make a point and keep it in the public eye."<br>
<b>Paul, Dengin Travellers</b><p>

"The Criminal Law should alienate criminals, not deprave members of the society....I have to say that travellers, ravers and squatters do not appear in the top ten of law and order priorities for the people or police officers in London."<br>
<b>Mike Bennett, Chair of Metropolitan Police Association</b><p>

"Imprisoning individuals whose lifestyle simply does not conform to the norm of society is rarely of a serious criminal nature, is expensive, futile and an abuse of human rights. On release squatters will not magically be provided with housing, travellers will not suddenly change their lifestyle, and young people will certainly not stop partying."<br>
<b>David Roddam, Penal Affairs Consortium</b><p>

"There is a danger of police officers becoming pawns in what is an essentially political game."<br>
<b>Det Inps John Woods, Police Review</b><p>

"The historical fact is that bad laws have been repeatedly overturned by illegal action. In a hundred years time, those involved in protest today may well be regarded as heroes."<br>
<b>PAJ Waddington, Liberty and Order</b><p>

"Everyone was waiting for the police to use it in a big way and they didn't. The huge amount of media attention given to the public order powers undoubtedly had an effect. But it's important to remember that the CJA is now on the books. The legislation is there and it can be used."<br>
<b>Attiya Lockwood, Liberty</b><p>

"Carry on breaking the law - it's only the only way to beat it."<br>
