<h2><A NAME="campsfield">HOSTILE HOSTEL</A></h2>

<strong>Asylum prisoners show their anger</strong> <p>
<em>"Campsfield is not a prison, it's a hostel regime"</em>
<br><strong>- Group 4 spokesman</strong> <p>


Last week, 200 asylum seekers at the Campsfield detention centre near
Oxford staged a full scale protest which caused an estimated
&#163;100,000 worth of property damage.  Several parts of the building
were completely destroyed.  <p>The 13 hour 'riot' began after one
person was removed to a prison without warning, a move campaigners
believe was designed to punish troublemakers. Over a quarter of
detainees were involved in the protest.  <p>More than 100 riot police
were drafted in to the centre to quell the protest and access roads
were blocked to stop campaigners who turned up to offer support.  <p>A
spokesman from Group 4, the security group that runs the prison,
denied that removal of the asylum seeker to a prison sparked off the
protest.  The company couldn't conclude what had created the
disturbance.

<em>"It is not up to us to speculate why it started... it is down to
the Immigration Service to decide who is moved." </em> <p>

An activist from the Campaign to Close Campsfield believed that the
decision was <em>"more likely made by Group 4, and rubber stamped by
the Home Office"</em> - as a way of making their lives easier.  <p>100
detainees have since been moved to other places "for their own safety"
as a result of the damage.

<p>Asylum seekers are held at Campsfield while they wait for their
cases to be resolved, which means in most cases until they are
deported back to the hellholes they fled from.  It is run like a
prison and surrounded by a razor wire perimeter fence.  A spokesman
from Group 4 told SchNEWS that, <em>"the fence is just as much there
to protect the inmates from people outside"</em>!

<p>Since Michael Howard's immigration reforms, asylum seekers are
detained in 'secure institutions', and are not eligible to receive
benefit while they wait for their claim for asylum to be heard.  Any
employer found hiring a refugee without a work permit is liable to a
&#163;5,000 fine.  <p>They have been charged with <em>no crime</em>,
but are detained as if they were criminals, often without access to
their families or legal representation.  So who are these refugees?
Just people, who come to this country seeking refuge from military
regimes and political persecution. People who have left behind their
lives, and often their families, in Nigeria, Russia, Romania, Algeria,
Somalia - to name a few.  They seek refuge in a country completely
alien to them, often in a traumatised and confused state.  <p>

The average <strong>length of wait</strong> at Campsfield for asylum
seekers is 4 to 8 months, and this is steadily increasing.  The number
of people waiting is also going up. A recent inter-departmental study
of the asylum problem admitted <em>"the backlog of more than 52,000
people awaiting processing of their applications is unacceptably
high." </em>

<ul>
<li>52,000 people awaiting asylum decision
<li>1,295 asylum seekers granted UK entry (1996)
<li>750 refugees placed in detention centres each year
</ul>

<p><em>"Before the new administration meddles in human rights issues
abroad, it should take a look at what's going on here."</em><br>
<strong>- Letter to the Guardian</strong> <p>

But where are the practical plans by our nice new Home Secretary to
deal with the applicants more quickly, and grant more people asylum?
<p>Despite claims by New Labour that they are <em>"putting human
rights at the centre of foreign policy"</em>, they aren't making it
any easier for those fleeing persecution to claim asylum.

<p>An asylum activist told SchNEWS, <em>"It takes a riot to get their
attention.  There's no sign of anything positive in the new
government; the law hasn't changed, and there's no commitment to stop
detaining people"</em>

<p>This is the third protest at Campsfield this year, and was by far
the biggest. Police are now considering whether to bring criminal
charges against protesters.

<ul>
<li>Vigils and demos are held on each Saturday at noon. Meet by the
camp gates, Campsfield, Langford Lane, Kidlington, 6 miles North of
Oxford. Ring 01865 558145 for more details.

<h2><A NAME="oil">Spoil the Oil Toil</A></h2>

Saturday saw the launch of 100 Days of Action against the oil
industry. That's 100 days until the Kyoto climate summit (see <a
href="news131.htm">SchNEWS 131</a>), follow up to Rio, when
world leaders will get together to decide to do nothing much about the
climate change and environmental destruction caused by fossil
fuels. Over 40 BP garages across the country were targetted on
Saturday and more actions will follow in the coming weeks, including
on 23-24 Sept "The Future of the UK Oil and Gas Industry" Conference
at the Mount Royal Hotel, London W1. All your favourite oil industry
bosses will be in one place at one time. Watch this space for more
info or Corporate Watch: 01865 791391. To get involved in the 100 Days

<h2><A NAME="ashton">The Action That Never Was</A></h2>
The planned action to close down Ashton Court quarry this week proved
incredibly easy.  Around fifty, mainly local, activists arrived at the
site of the quarry near Bristol early Tuesday morning.  The entrance
to the quarry had been blockaded by a tripod, the handful of police
and security put up little opposition to those who entered the site.
Unfortunately (!?) the eager digger-divers were unable to stop work as
some spoilsports had, allegedly, entered the site the previous day and
"tampered" with machinery.  The site is expected to be "closed for
repairs" for some time.

<h2><A NAME="gandalf">Gandalf Trial Update</A></h2> 
The trial of the editors of Green Anarchist started this week with
over 40 people demonstrating outside Portsmouth Crown Court,
protesting against state oppression and attacks on the free speech of
those reporting animal and earth abuse. There was also a cycle
blockade outside the local Police station, and leaflets advertising
the trial were distributed. During the first day the defence were not
allowed into court, while the judge and prosecution decided what
information to censor with Public Interest Immunity Certificates. The
judge, David Selwood, conceded in the first day that 2 people whom the
defence suspect of having MI5 links (Tim Hepple and Tim Hall) do
indeed have MI5 files, and that the branch of MI5 that dealt with
Green activists folded 2 years ago, and passed its files on to Special
Branch, who deal with the Animal Rights National Index (strangely this
was around the same time that the original operation by Special Branch
against Green Anarchist began!).  <p>

A troublesome jury selection was completed on Thursday: The defence
wanted to exclude jurors with connections to roadbuilding, animal
abuse or the military, while the prosecution wanted to exclude anyone
who opposes the above-mentioned evildoers.  The result of these
objections is that the original pool of 45 potential jurors has been
reduced to 14, ie 12 jurors and 2 reserves, and more may yet drop out.
Judge Selwood, perhaps not incidentally, has spent almost his entire
career as a judge in military courts, and still holds the rank of
Major-General.  Another rather ominous sign is that Det. Supt. Desmond
Thomas, the officer commanding the Special Branch operation against
GA, was spotted giving Masonic signals from the witness box.  Nice to
know British courts are as impartial as ever.  <p>

<h2><A NAME="finally">and finally</A></h2>
Hey, did any SchNEWS readers spot irritating Tory chief git William
Hague at the Notting Hill Carnival? I hope he wasn't near any of those
soundsystems playing "music characterised by a series of loud and
repetitive beats" - you know the music his government made illegal
under the CJA? And I hope he was wasn't standing next to groups of
black people - 'cos as former Tory MP Terry Dicks once said when they
all get together it leads to "street crime and all kinds of
vice-related crime." And what about his government's Immigration and
Asylum Act clamping down on those fraudsters who pretend they've been
tortured so they can live here and sponge off our welfare state? (cue
