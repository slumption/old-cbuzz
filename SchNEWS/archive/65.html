The heat is on...voices of dissent are silenced and groups targeted. Two years ago alternative lifestyles were criminalised with the Criminal Justice Act, this year the Asylum seekers get the rap, and soon the viciousness will extend to the unemployed with the introduction of the JobSeekers Allowance and Work-for-your-dole-Fare. Who next, we wonder?<p>
Out of this pressure arises a resilience, an imagination and flair that constantly catches the attention of the public and media.<p>
But... how do groups direct that public support from the side-lines to the front-line? Thousands rally against the Newbury Bypass but only a few hundred stay for the direct action. Locals were short on the ground when the forces of destruction descended upon Selar Farm in Wales to pave way for an open-cast monster. The Green Party Conference cries, claps and cheers the SchLIVE tour but groups still tell us to write to our MP. Are we too wild? Too wacky? Too ignorant? Too arrogant? <p> 
So this is a plea -  judging by our mail we expect most SchNEWS readers are pretty much on the case - but what about your friends, your mum, dads, granddads and grannies...? You don't have to have dreads and a trench coat to care about the world in which you want to live.<p>
At Shoreham, it was only people's direct experience that changed their views. So read these words, then treat them as an incentive to get involved and see with your own eyes what�s happening to Britain in the '90's...It�s up to us.<p>
<a name=ARTICLE2><HR width=80% size=3><center><H1>SQUATTERS ESTATE AGENTS</H1><p></center>

Early Friday morning saw 25 of us successfully barring the bailiffs from entering and evicting Justice's? Squatters Estate Agents. After successfully opening the shop for a further few days the estate agent's doors were finally shut on Tuesday morning - due to a syndrome known as Activist Burn Out, and a common desire to Reclaim Our Lives! With still no sign of the bailiffs on Tuesday (allegedly a 30 strong force pulled in from around the county had been mobilised) we decided to tidy up, recycle the empties, barricade the building and leave via the upstairs window. When the bailiffs, the police and the media went in at 8:00pm they were forced to break their way in. One reporter said that he was impressed by the way the building had been cleaned up. The Squatters Estate Agency is now well boarded up with a metal bar securing the doors and windows. Are they nervous? <P> 
But that's not the end.  Justice? have had a list of empty properties for over a year - we intend to continue this service with squatting advice for an hour a week - if you have a room that we can use for this purpose and haven't been scared off by the Evening Anus bullshit - give us a ring: 01273 685913<P>
*An international e-mail Squatlink  has been set up to link up all the squatting groups - to get on the list send an e-mail address to <A HREF=MAILTO:pepe@iww.org>pepe@iww.org</A>

There were more full-on evictions at Newbury this week, as the Go-Tan and Kennet camps were attacked. The scab climbers used to evict people from the trees got quite a surprise at Go-tan when they were confronted by a team of Sheffield activist climbers who were none too happy about the bad name they were giving the profession. A 3 hour battle ensued, where the climbers were repeatedly repulsed, and one bailiff ended up being tied to a tree! There were 38 arrests, with 2 climbers being charged with kidnap and violent disorder.<P>
On Wednesday it was Kennet's turn, and people were rudely awakened at 4.30 am to the sight of police and climbers wading the swamp that the site had become after a mysteriously flood the night before! Access routes to the camp were cut in the dark, with climbers waving knives and spitting at people. Walkways were cut as they were in use, leaving two people hanging precariously 40 feet above the ground on a single, frayed polyprop line that was nearly cut. This over-the-top operation saw a unit of police divers in inflatables being used to seal the canal! As <B>SchNEWS</B> went to press, by Thursday afternoon, there had been 17 arrests, and there was one net and one treehouse left on this Site of Special Scientific Interest.<BR>

Security costs have been estimated at �500,000 a week, and the police have already gone over budget, spending over �1m in the first 2 months. 
Finally, there have been a couple of cases of people with warrants for previous convictions getting nicked at Newbury, and being held inside on remand. The <B>SchNEWS</B> would <I>never</I> advise its readers to lie to the Police, but if you are wanted for something and you think you might  get nicked at Newbury, perhaps  it would be an idea to change your name (it's free to do it by deed poll if you're on the dole! Hello Mr Red Earth)  <P>

* Please get involved in more pro-active actions which are proving to be very effective. Ring Ian at the Reclaim The Streets office on 0171 249 9114. He's willing to facilitate different groups with equipment, briefings, reckies - give 'em a bell  and get on the case and in their Newbury face.

Court hearings have begun over last December's Whatley Quarry action when 55 people were arrested during an action which cost ARC/Hanson �300,000. So far everyone charged for aggravated trespass has been found guilty and fined up to �370.  A bit much when you look at <A HREF="#inside">Inside SchNEWS</A> and see what three prison officers got for assault!<P>
Whatley Quarry is one of the largest in Europe-290 acres, a mile long and100 metres deep.  But that's not enough for Arc/Hanson who want to double its size, cutting into the Mendip Hills and even threatening the ancient Bath hot springs.<P>  
And all this for some pebbles?  Well roadstone actually, sold from the Quarry at �2/�3 per tonne, often destined for roadschemes we all know and love and transported out by lorries leaving site every minute during the day. ARC/Hansons's press statement bizarrely states they were sure that "had the demonstrators read the company planning application, the environmental activists would be supporting the proposed quarry expansion". !<P>
So was the action worth it?  Construction News reckons 
"The high-profile raid by environmental activists at Whatley Quarry will send shivers down the spine of most in the construction industry. ... The lesson learnt from the roads protests is that it is folly to dismiss the claims of the environmentalists as ill-informed claptrap." <P> 
If you can help those charged a bust fund is being set up , and will rather appropriately (or inappropriately, depending on your angle!) be named "Sponsor a Criminal"! Details to follow...

Despite the full-on eviction of Selar Farm a couple of weeks ago, plans are underway to establish another camp on the land of the proposed largest open cast mine in the country (at 880 acres the hole will be visible from the moon!)  Workers are needed urgently.  Bailiffs and security again moved in on Wednesday and trashed more trees - so the initial camp might be on private land for the time being   <B>01639 720884</B>

Oop North in Manchester ex-security guards fed up with low pay and crap treatment by Kennedy's, (the firm involved in the recent eviction of the Daisy Nook Camp) have been getting revenge.   Ex-guards have been visiting the new compound site, smashing it up and one of 'em knocked out his old boss!  A new camp has been established helping to hinder work on the M66 which is now two and a half months behind schedule! Ring <B>0161 2489268</B> for info.

Last Saturday, people from all walks of life were called to witness the trial of the motor car. The charge it had to defend was of "destroying people and nature, and being a non-sustainable means of mass transport". <P>
The event, at York Castle, included representatives from both ends of the scale, from motor traders and road builders, to environmentalists and community groups. When asked how it pleaded, the car maintained it's right to silence, implying guilt under Section 34 of the CJA. No one would stand in its defence and after attack from the ALF, a Luddite and Henry Ford, the car was found guilty.<P>
York Castle incidentally is the site of the hanging of 14 Luddites in 1812. The Luddites sought to protect their skills and livelihoods from the thieving clutches of pioneer industrialists. Luddite demonstrations were carefully organised complex social events aimed at highlighting unfairness and achieving justice. <B>SchNEWS</B> is not in favour of the death penalty, but in this case we can make an exception. HANG THE CAR BY THE EXHAUST PIPE UNTIL IT IS VERY, VERY DEAD!

The TEN scheme introduces more than 12,000 kilometres of new motorways and thousands of kilometres of high speed rail links as part of a European transport infra-structure. <P>
This could be the biggest protest against the Trans European Networks (TEN) with local actions all around Europe. It gives groups a chance to show the widespread resistance against the destructive infiltration of transport systems. Actions will include Critical Masses, NVDA, proposed route walks, exhibitions, workshops, street theatre, parties and concerts.<P>

Gary Mills and Tony Poole are going to the High Court on February 12th-15th to appeal against their convictions for murder  -framed by the Gloucester Police. They were given life sentences in 1990 for the murder of Hensley Wiltshire who died after 12 hours in Gloucester police station, which he left with 60% more injuries than he arrived with.<p> 
There's a benefit gig for Satpal Ram, who has already spent nearly nine years in prison for defending himself against a racist gang (see SchNEWS 44) on Thursday 29th February. A very special benefit too - it's the London premier of Banner Theatre's anti-CJA play <b>Criminal Justice</b> - and worth getting along to. It's at the Red Rose Club, 129 Seven Sisters Road (�5/�3).

***Boycotts can work!  The Bordeaux wine industry last week said that it had been severely hit by boycotts over French nuclear testing - and that it would take several years to repair the damage.

Road builders wreck our countryside, billboards tell us to buy crap- but try making a difference to how your town looks without official permission and you get hammered big time. This week Simon Sutherland got sent down for five years  for daubing graffiti in his home town of Sheffield. Just like squatters, poor people and all us other undesirables it just isn't done to let us take control over anything, including the look of our town. As one of Simon's slogans put it, "In a society based on image, greed, selfishness - we are the few who have broken the chains by exposing our art by any means necessary". Nice one, Simon.

Some 9 months since live animal exports from Shoreham ceased, and the police operation against those who protested against it continues.  Immediately after returning home from hospital following a major operation, an ex-Shoreham protestors house was raided. searched and she was then arrested on a surprise, surprise, conspiracy charge, relating to events of over a year ago.  On her solicitors appeal that her healing process would suffer with the stress, the police reluctantly conducted a de-arrest, promising to re-arrest her a fortnight later!  Further representation by the solicitor resulted in an agreement to surrender her to a local police station in 4 weeks time.  She was told she must 'expect to be in the station for at least sixteen hours, probably longer'.  Could this harassment have anything to do with the fact that she is a defence witness for another protester held on remand at Holloway for over a year now for the same alleged offence?

Crap political stand of the week has surely got to go to Elio Botta of Rome. The former comedian and actor created the "Rebirth Movement"  a one-man pressure group for people living on the streets. Botta hoped to gather enough support from other homeless people  to run for parliament in the April 21 election. The launch was in Santta Maria  in Trastevere Square, near where he lives on the street, saying he wanted to draw attention to social issues during the campaign.<P>
The party's emblem is a stick with a bundle of belongings  attached, which he called  the archetypal symbol of homelessness. The bearded Botta who gave his age as "around 37" , brought none of the trappings usually found at party launches, such a glossy literature and campaign aides. he appeared alone equipped only with a tattered, spiral- spined notebook!<P>
"Given that  I'm the leader of a political movement, my only appeal is for someone to lend me a mobile telephone until after the election," he said. None of the reporters present obliged. Sad really!!!
