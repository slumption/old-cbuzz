<p>
Anti-open-cast mine activists were last night holding out,  five days into a tree-top battle in Brynhenllys, South Wales, to stop a monster development that will gauge a hole visible from space out of the heart of the Welsh valleys.<p>
Scores of  baliffs, climbers and security hired by Celtic Energy - who stand to make millions from the 'wanton destruction' - have so far failed in their high-risk attempt to evict all the protestors dangling from walkways and makeshift platforms high up in the trees. Watching the chainsaws flying from  below are local residents who have been fighting the proposals for 14 years. They"ve been joined by children on half-term holiday, while police - backed up with a helicopter - and sheriff's men stand guard. Bailiffs stand accused of endangering lives - cutting walkways 40ft in the air with people still on them, and chainsawing the branches of a Corsican Pine from above the heads of protestors clinging on.  One local resident, Nigel Faulkner, told <b>SchNEWS</b>: ""Their behaviour has been appalling, putting life and limb at risk, while the decency of the protestors has been a hallmark of the week - they are brilliant people battling every inch of the way."<p>

Brynhenllys Open-Cast, a mind-boggling 770 acres and 200m deep - twice the size of Glastonbury Festival - will be the second largest open-cast site in Europe. The largest by a fraction will be at Selar Nature Reserve near Cwmgwrach,  just fifteen miles away, where another troop of tree-dwelling protestors are bracing themselves for possible eviction on Monday.<p> 

These two vast holes will wipe out a fifth of Brecon Beacons National Park, 880 acres of lush watermeadow, ancient oak woodland and a designated Site of Special Scientfic Interest, the home of the protected Marsh Fritillary butterfly and nesting places of Perigrine Falcons, and remote wilderness of oaks, beech, ash and pine. 
Property prices have plummeted as the landscape is ravaged and asthma rates expected to soar. Dr Mark Temple, writing in <b>The Lancet </b>  reported 30% more sufferers amongst residents at another nearby open-cast site. "Once the ecology has been destroyed it's gone forever. There are already signs of desertification from previous mining, according to a visiting professor from Algeria " said a spokesman for Wales Against Opencast.<p>

Even police and security are in revolt. At least thirty people have been arrested for Public Order offences this week but released with out charge - and without bail conditions, freeing them to continue the protest. Dyfed Police have shown their feelings by virtually working to rule, and have been, in the words of one activist, "brilliant". The private company Reliant Security, well known from the No M11 Link Road campiagn - have been bussed in from London to deal with the protests. But many have left in disgust at conditions forcing them to work 34hr shifts with no food or accomodation. On Tuesday night both protestors and security were forced to share the only shelter in the area - the Long Barn - creating the bizarre situation of sitting round the same fire and sharing chips! "Most of the security are being used as slaves. They are predomintly black immigrants who don't know why they are here," said one protestor. The same climbers who were vilified by members of their own profession for evicting protestors at a similar tree-top drama at Stanworth Valley nr Preston in May, are being used, as no-one else will take the job on.<p>

Local valley communities such as Brynhenllys and Cwmgwrach  have been devesatated by the closure of  all the deepcast mines.in Wales.   Closed - they were told - because  there was no demand for coal. But a week after Tower Colliery the last pit in Wales was shut the application was put in for Selar!  Tower has since re-opened as a workers  co-op employing 300 men and making a healthy profit.   The Selar site is only 3 miles away from Tower and could be deep-cast mined creating a further 300 jobs instead of the unskilled handful the open-cast mine will create .  Even a Public Inquiry over Brynhenllys  found against the proposal but this was overturned and the project rubber-stamped by the Welsh Office. "We exhausted the legal process utterly and direct action was the only option left. It's been fantastic in fostering a new community spirit, " one Brynhenllys resident told <b>SchNEWS</b>.<p>

* Wanna-be PM Michael Heseltine, the man blamed for the most recent closure of Britain's pits, recently found himself the victim of direct action from people opposing open cast mining.  One Sunday morning in September he awoke to find a motley collection of  ex-miners, trade union members and environmentalists digging up his lawn in the search for coal!  Claiming it was only a prelimenary visit they've also put in a planning application to Northamptonshire County Council for permission to  sink a mine in the whole of his back garden.....<p>

Good <b>SchNEWS</b> for once: plans for a National Forest that have been floating about for  about six years, are actually about to be put into action.  Farmers in the Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire area, are being given grants to plant trees on the land, which is in shit nick because of clay extraction, open cast mining etc.  The forest should eventually be the size of a county (distant future).  Unfortunately, farmers are causing a bit of fuss about public access and as usual, one of the main concerns is how the scheme can be made to generate money<p> *** 'They Call This Justice?' is a new tape from Freedom Network with 90 minutes of cool music.  To be the proud owner of a copy, send �2.50 (payable to J. Fowers) to<br> <b>PO Box 7279, London E11 4TY</b><p> *** Four people from Manchester Earth First! were nicked yesterday for getting on the roof at the opening ceremony of a new Sainsburys. Originally charged with 'Breach of the Peace' they were kept overnight in the cells, and just before court , were charged under sections  68 and 61  of the CJA - the later section is aimed at travellers!<p> *** For all you assorted itinerants SQUALL (Autumn 95 ) is out now. <br> �1.50 + 80 p&p from <b>PO Box 8959, London, N19 5HW</b> <br>alternatively  �10 will get you a years sub from one of the best mags around....."Stoke it up!"<p> *** The Reclaim the Streets party in Manchester last week saw 600 people close a central shopping street for a few hours.  The event highlighted Manchester's acute traffic problem, engineered by a council which has consistently moved to attract more cars into the city centre, despite it being Britain's most polluted city.  Critical Massers cycled all the way from the  Birmingham , Liverpool and Kendall to get to their (OK some of them ended up getting the train halfway).  The only arrest was a crap one and the day ended peacefully - just not as early as the police were hoping for.... <br>- Reclaim the Streets Party in London this Sunday - meet at Paddington Station at 10am or ring  0956 300 676 after 10am for actual venue<br> (and if you're heading from Brighton then meet  10am outside the old RSPCA building opposite the Level) <br>- Critical Mass in Worthing  Sat 4th Nov.  meet 12 noon Steyne Gardens<p> *** And now for a new and original view from the future King of England.  Prince Charles reckons current car culture is unsustainable, damaging to the environment, our health and community life.  He continues "there are dozens of possible solutions, many of which are being put into practice".

A road protestor from the  Flat Oak Tribe  could be the first person in the country to be  jailed under the Criminal justice Act (CJA) - ironically a year to the day since it became law.<br> 
David Hilton (Iggy)  has been remanded at Canterbury prison for a further two weeks while a Probation Report is prepared. He was already spent  eight days  inside on  remand after  being nicked for " aggravated trespass"  (for the second time) and  breaking his bail conditions  by jumping into a cement mixer at the Thanet Way in Kent. He  has said in previous court cases that he  does not recognise the CJA and is therefore unable to abide by its bail conditions which  -  thanks to the Act are  now set by the police - and in Iggy's case stated he was 'not to  obstruct any lawful  activity on the Thanet Way'.<br>
Some of the reasons given for further imprisonment included  -  it is for his own protection,  he was putting his own life and others at risk  and that his offences are "series"  !    He will be sentenced next Friday (3rd November) at Canterbury and  there will be a big demonstration outside the court  9.30 am 
In the meantime please send letters of support  to<br><center><b> David Hilton LW 0848,<br> HMP Canterbury , 46 Longport, Canterbury, Kent, CT1  1PJ</b></center><p>
*  On the Saturday (4th) there will be a  "Reclaim The Land" action in Canterbury.  A party will be held on a public green space in Canterbury which the Council want to close off and basically have no right to do so as it isn't theirs!  01227 463368<p>

" Whatever  your personal grievance, these days there's an action group that shares your view.  And today action can take many forms, from lying down on busy roads (<b>Reclaim The Streets</b>) to doing nothing in the name of abolishing all waged labour (<b>Brighton Autonomists</b>)....For those who just want to protest, but don't know why, there are groups like Justice?, a self-styled  'Full-on rent-a-mob anytime, anyplace, anywhere!', that offer action without demanding commitment.  If you would like a fabby acronym and want to appear radical, then <b>Workers Against Nasty Killings Especially Revolutionaries</b> is the action group requiring only a commitment to 'pontificating and waiting for the mythical revolution'.  And if even that's too much effort, there's always the option of blind faith in <b>Bob- Church of the Sub-Genius</b>, the only hope of saviour from the 'aliens too hideously ugly to describe' it claims are running the planet.

<b>DIFFERENT TIME, SAME SENTIMENTS:</b><br>
"The beggars, who had formerly obtained relief at the gates of the monasteries and convents, now wandered in crowds through the country, and by their numbers and importunities often extorted alms from the intimidated passenger. To abate this nuisance, a statute was enacted...so whosoever 'lived idly and loiteringly for the space of three days' came under the description of a vagabond and was liable to the following punishment. Two justices of the peace might order the letter 'V' to be burnt on his breast, and judge him to serve the informer as his slave. His master was bound to provide him with bread,water, and refuse meat; might fix an iron ring round his neck,arm, or leg, and was authorised to compel him to "labour at any work, however vile it might be, by beating, chaining, or otherwise". If the slave absented himself for a fortnight, the letter 'S' was burnt into his cheek or forehead, and he became a slave for life." <b>Vagrancy Act 1547</b>

The latest campaign  from the states is for  a new ice-cream flavour with a difference! Stateside supporters of deathrow prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal have been writing to Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream (who donate a percentage of their profits to progressive causes) suggesting they create a Mumia flavour ice-cream and donate the profits to his defence campaign. Initial reaction suggests that Ben & Jerry , the firms founders (who named the Cherry Garcia flavour after the Grateful Dead singer) are sympathetic to the idea - they sent a free ice-cream voucher to the person who wrote in and suggested it.<br><center> Join the campaign, write to: <br><b>Ben Cohn & Jerry Greenfield,<br> Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream, PO Box 240, Waterberry, VT 05676, USA. </b><br>and pig out for freedom.</center>
