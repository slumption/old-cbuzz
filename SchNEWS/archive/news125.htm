<A NAME="meeting">WE'RE NOT PARANOID, BUT...</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>They're</em> at it again.<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;...a clique of the richest, economically and
politically most powerful and influential men in the Western world, who meet
secretly to plan events that later appear just to
happen.&quot;</em><br><strong>- The Times 1977 </strong><p>
<strong></strong>A month before the Earth Summit review in New York ended in a
shambles, another rather more secret affair was taking place in America -  at
the Renaissance Pine Isle Resort in the Appalachian mountains.  <p>
However, you wouldn't have heard much about this meeting, where 120 of the
world's most powerful men didn't meet in a four-day secret session to not
discuss the future shape of the western world. Honest. They were merely there
on a jolly holiday. <p>
&quot;<em>They are a world business block...these are the people deciding our
future, but nobody  elects them.&quot;<br><strong>- </strong></em><strong>Col.
Barry Turner</strong><p>
<strong></strong>Welcome to the Bilderberg Group. The group takes its name from
the Hotel Bilderberg in Holland where it first met in 1954, but it's only in
the last couple of years that its existence has become more widely known
outside the inner circle. Last year's Bilderberg AGM took place at the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce Leadership Center in Montreal, and was hosted by
Canadian press baron Conrad Black. <p>
So what do these  men talk about? Jack Sheinkman, Chair of the US Amalgamated
Bank and ex-Bilderberg member, said in June 96:<p>
<em>&quot;The idea of a single currency was discussed several years back before
it became policy.&quot; </em><p>
<em></em>Now they are the driving force behind the policies of globalisation,
increasing the power of Multinational Corporations and banks over western
politicians and bringing even more private gain for the worlds political and
corporate &eacute;lite. <p>
One of the reasons that the media have been so slow to investigate and report
on the Bilderbergers is that many of the global press bosses, including Peter
Job, Chief Executive of Reuters, are part of the group. According to Spotlight,
the Associated Press avoids mentioning Bilderberg because its biggest paying
clients, the metropolitan newspapers, want silence on its existence.  However,
somehow in 1995 the Swiss AP Bureau did not get the message: <em>&quot;World
leaders...120 members of the political and business elite...massive police
presence with army backup...four days of secret meetings.</em>&quot; When a
columnist for the Evening Standard mentioned the group a few years back he lost
his job a couple of weeks later. <p>
Gorden Tether, the Editor of the Financial Times long-running Lombard column,
was sacked by the editor (a Bilderberger) for refusing to erase references to
the Bilderberg Group. <p>
&quot;<em>To this day no one knows if this is its real name, since it goes to
any lengths to avoid publicity... the goal of creating world government still
seems to be its main driving force... In 1989 it was alleged to have plotted
the political assassination of Margaret Thatcher because of her refusal to
yield British sovereignty to the European superstate.&quot;</em>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong><em>Conspiracy</em> -</strong> Act of conspiring (in good or bad

<A NAME="crap">Crap Arrest of the Week</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Pigs arrested a chicken, a cow, a bucket and a table outside
Portsmouth McDonalds' last week. Two women holding up a `McCrap' banner were
also arrested under section 5 of the Public Order Act... for causing alarm and
distress!

<h2>
<A NAME="timor">Murdering Bastards plc</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>We're always mentioning the East Timor situation in SchNEWS,
albeit briefly, but how many people know the full extent of British `Ethical'
Foreign Policy? Well, here goes:  Indonesia, the world's third most populous
state and the largest purchaser of British weapons outside Europe, has occupied
East Timor since invading in 1975.  A third of the population has been killed
by the occupying forces, the worst genocide as a proportion of population since
the Nazi holocaust.  <p>
 Despite supporting UN resolutions condemning the occupation, the British
government has continued to licence the export of military equipment to
Indonesia, British Aerospace having the biggest share including the Hawk
aircraft (subject to a successful action by Ploughshares women last year), and
submachine guns and assault rifles via its subsidiary company, Heckler &amp;
Koch.  <p>
PSI come second after BAe, providing armoured vehicles including the Tactica
water cannon which is used by Indonesian police to spray demonstrators with a
chemical mixture that burns the skin and eyes and an indelible purple dye to
make it easier to round 'em up later.  PSI's scumbag MD Nicholas Oliver, who
claims to have been out &quot;on patrol&quot;  in East Timor  himself, boasts
of having done &#163;400 million worth of business in Indonesia in the last
four years, with another &#163;700 million worth  &quot;in the pipeline&quot;.
He also claims to have received verbal assurances from Tony Blair that the
export licenses &quot;would not present a problem&quot; for  carin', sharin'
New Labour, which phony Tony says he can't remember giving. Godalming-based
Nitor Group are on the gravy train too.  They supply the ULTIMA multimedia
firearms training system which features a program  training marksmen to shoot
unarmed protesters.  <p>
 Despite twenty years of torture and genocide, and in the face of overwhelming
British-supplied firepower, the people of East Timor are still fighting to free
their country.  In the words of an East Timorese activist:  &quot;<em>No amount
of weapons or force of repression will be ever enough to subjugate a people
forever.&quot;</em>  <p>
 If anyone is interested in doing something to help the people of East Timor,
perhaps by helping to organise an activists' day out to a mystery location in
the South of England, please call the Justice? office on 01273 685913.
Alternatively, call PSI (01722 414004) or Nitor (01483 426299), and tell them
what you think.  For more info on the arms trade generally, or on specific
companies, call Campaign Against the Arms Trade (0171 2810297).

<li>	A new peace camp has been set up outside Alvis, the Coventry firm that
sells Scorpion tanks to Indonesia. If you're going past the M6 why not drop in
on  the Peace Camp, Alvis factory, Northview, Walsgrave, Coventry or give 'em a
call on 01926 338805</ul>

<A NAME="faslane">Save Faslane</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Faslane Peace camp, established 15 years ago in protest
against the Trident Nuclear Submarine Base in Helensburgh Scotland, is due to
be evicted. The site, which has had 1090 arrests in those 15 years and has both
national and international support, has had an eviction notice served for 28th
July. The issue has arisen now because of a change in Scottish Local
Authorities. Before April 1996, the camp had both a lease and planning
permission from two different councils. Now the site comes under sole
jurisdiction of Argyle and Bute Council - a strange political beast ruled by
&quot; independent&quot; councillors (ehm...) who all vote together, as chums,
in a solid block. <p>
It is also interesting to note that  behind the camp lies  an expanse of MoD
land for sale, up for grabs to any passing Multi-national. Wouldn't it be awful
having a dirty protest site on their doorstep!!! Need lots of people, lots of
support!!

<li>Contrary to previous information, Project Work - the dole
policy of coercing people into work by giving them nothing to live on if they
refuse  any old McJob- has not been abolished, merely given a poll tax style
name change to <strong>Welfare to Work</strong>. But, in a rare burst of
humanitarianism, New Labour have scrapped the forthcoming plans to extend the
Housing Benefit restrictions to over 25's in October, and are apparently
reviewing the mess already in place for the under-25's: in Brighton, 99% of
landlords working with the Housing Trust won't deal with them. On the same tip,
&quot;New Labour - same old rip off?&quot; Public meeting at the Prince Albert
pub, Trafalgar street, Brighton. Wednesday July 9th @ 7pm
<li>	Check out the brilliant <strong>Do or Die 6</strong> which has finally

on the route of  proposed bypass around Bingley, West Yorkshire. They have
three weeks before a decision is to be made as to whether the road is to go
ahead or not. Lots of support needed. For more info: 0370 985 122
<li>	<strong>Lyminge Forest </strong>- After a meeting  this week, its announced
that Wank Rank want the land by September, causing a panic for those in the
Forestry Commission (having to sell `cos they're skint) - Get down there NOW

<A NAME="bus">Mad For It</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>A bus driver taking 20 mental patients from the Zimbabwe
capital city of Harare to Bulawayo Mental Hospital decided to stop for a few
drinks at an illegal roadside liquor store. Upon his return he was shocked to
discover that all the patients had escaped, and, desperate for a solution, he
stopped at the next bus and offered free bus rides to several people. He then
took them to the  hospital, informing  staff they were easily excitable! It
took the medical personnel 3 days to uncover the foul play. The real patients
are still at large.

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>After 7 street parties, 3 trips to Bosnia and 5 years in
Europe, Desert Storm finally got their truck and rig confiscated...in Bristol!
On the Sunday morning after the Britsol Summer Solstice Street Party cops
pounced on the truck and arrested two people for `conspiracy to cause a public
nuisance.' One of the crew told SchNEWS &quot;They got everything.&quot; Keep
yer ear to the ground for  details of benefit gigs and dig deep, the 'ardcore
crew deserve your support.<p>

<A NAME="finally">and finally</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Did you ever get the feeling that conspiracists were just some
of the wackier activists you know? Well, judging by this advice from  the
organisers of the Copex Arms Exhibition to potential exhibitors... maybe not.<p>
    `Protesters' are hardened political activists, well trained and funded and
looking to cause as much confrontation with authority as possible on the one
hand and inflict as much economic damage as possible on the other...
Increasingly their funding and training is attracting support from Russian
organised crime ... The protesters we deal with generally target their appeals
to middle class sources; often aged, widowed ladies, who are duped into
thinking they are alleviating inhuman practices and the scourge of war. They
are, in fact, funding left wing political extremists whose goal is to
destabilise the country and discredit the rule of law... Remember, these are
professional protesters; the protest industry are mainly anarchists, they just
put on different hats to confront authority and the status quo... Any cause
will do!&quot;<p>
     Well now you know, eh? . If you are as impressed by COPEX's logic as we
were, you might like to get in touch at the following locations. <p>
