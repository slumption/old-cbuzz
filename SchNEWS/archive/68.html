<b>In case you blinked and missed it, parliament has just passed a law giving draconian new powers to the police. In a matter of two days the government, with the "opposition" as usual doing nothing to oppose them, has rushed through a law giving police the power to stop and search anyone without reasonable suspicion for a period of up to 28 days in "designated areas". If you refuse to be searched or resist being forcibly searched in any way you can be put in prison for up to six months. A string of other new police powers have been rushed through including the power to search houses and people in houses within a "cordoned-off area". The extent of these new powers, and the speed with which they have been rushed through parliament led one of the few MPs who voted against the legislation to say that if this is what democracy was about "we might as well go home". </b><p>
The new powers are additions to the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), a law that has been used to harass the Irish community in Britain since it was introduced by a Labour government in 1974. Since then over 7,000 completely innocent people, the vast majority of them Irish, have been arrested under the Act, which even the Home Secretary who brought it in admitted was "draconian". Last year 600 people were arrested under the PTA - not one of them has been convicted of any offence. The Act has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights, an institution well known to the British government - Michael Howard is the worst serial offender the court's ever had to deal with. <p>
The new stop and search powers have nothing to do with stopping bombers; they have a lot to do with harassing Irish people and, increasingly, lots more groups the government wants to pick on.  The police love having the power to stop and search, preferably without having to think up some reason for doing so, and this new law goes hand in hand with increased use by police of existing powers. For instance stop and search for drugs has increased by 32% over the last two years, with 85% of those stopped not being charged with anything.  It's racist too, funnily enough - 60% of people stopped and searched in London are black or Asian. <p>
If anyone still thought that politicians, especially Labour ones, were going to do anything to defend our basic rights they would be mad to think so after the lightning speed with which these new laws have been rushed through. Three weeks ago Labour dropped its opposition to the PTA to show it was just as "tough" as the Tories. Now Jack Straw, Labour's shadow Home Secretary, agrees not to oppose the new stop and search laws after a "briefing" from the security services (who runs this country again?). If the Tories proposed killing every first born of the unemployed next week Labour would more than likely go along with it for fear of losing the middle class votes they'd sell their granny for. <p>
The introduction of this law within a week of proposals that green activists (that's you, folks!) should be monitored by the anti-terrorist squad shows the way the police and politicians are thinking. Anyone doing any action, making any protest, seems to be a potential "terrorist" now. The main reason they introduce laws like the PTA and CJA is to scare people into sitting at home and doing nothing - and what is really pissing them off is that it's just not working! Reclaim the Streets, road protests, Critical Mass, squatting in high streets - we've always known that the only way to defend our rights and save the planet was through direct action that ignores their stupid laws.  They've arrested over 700 people at Newbury using the CJA and all they've done is strengthen a movement that is looking forward to a summer of in-your-face actions. They can pass all the laws they like - all they'll get are more people partying, more people protesting and more people feeling nothing but contempt for those obnoxious little politicians in Westminster.<p>

Diane Selvanayagam  and Laura Nicol have become the first people in the country to be sent to prison for "aggravated trespass", the arrest-all-protestors clause introduced under the Criminal Justice Act. Both got 28 days for  blocking the entrance to Albert Hall Farm in York - a farm which had been shipping calves to the continent until the BSE scare halted live animal exports, and a scene of protests for over a year. <p>
Diane d-locked her neck to the steering wheel of a vehicle, then locked arms with Laura thru' a section of plastic drainpipe.  Confused coppers scratched their heads for two hours before the break-down service removed them with the steering wheel still locked onto Diane's neck!<p>
Diane told SchNEWS  that on sentencing, the local Easingwold magistrate said it was 'time to take us more seriously'  Both are committed hunt sabs with over half a dozen previous convictions for 'agg.trespass'.  They both refused community service as they didn't think what they'd done was wrong.  "I was able to tell the court why I feel the need to break their immoral laws which are designed to protect money and property to the detriment of the lives of sentient beings.  I make absolutely no apology for my actions and will continue to carry out similar non-violent direct actions in the future.  The whole prison experience was incredibly empowering." <p>
Diane is now out of nick but Laura is still inside because of non-payment of fines- and needs your letters of support .  Diane added "The importance of writing to those who are imprisoned for their acts of compassion cannot be overstated.  In addition to helping the activist keep up their spirits, it serves to show those in positions of power that we are a real force to be reckoned with."

<b>What is "aggravated trespass"? </b><br>
Sections 68 + 69 <br>
A person commits this offence if they trespass on private land with the intention of stopping people carrying out their lawful activity (such as killing foxes or chopping down trees) .  Infact you can be nicked under this clause even if a senior police officer at the scene just thinks you are intending to disrupt! It carries a maximum sentence of three months in prison or a �3,000 fine.  But new protestors don't be scared off - your  first offence if found guilty is only likely to  be a fine. <p>

Castle Wood, the final camp on the site at Newbury was evicted on Tuesday.  85 days, 29 camps and 770 arrests after clearance work began, and at a cost of �1.5million (three times the estimated cost) the roadbuilders have completed one phase of their precious bypass. Cocky Under Sheriff Blandy organised a press conference to announce his "victory" over the protesters - and was promptly run outta town by protesters who did not look very "beaten" at all! Blandy and his mates obviously aren't as confident and victorious as they like to make out - they are now looking at spending �6 million on putting 20 miles of fencing around the route!  Apparently there's an end of springterm school feeling at Newbury as protesters have a break before the next stage of the actions. Lotta continua!<p>
So far, �12 billion pounds has been axed off the roads programme. More will most probably go in the next budget in November. The roads programme, once the pride of the DoT's mad-cap scheme to Tarmac this sceptred isle, is now seriously hobbled, perhaps, in the long term, fatally wounded. The trees at Newbury may be gone, but construction work will not commence until the summer, due to budgetary difficulties. As yet, no-one has (dared volunteer) been selected to carry out this dirty deed. Work at the M11 and Solsbury Hill has been seriously plagued by rapidly emptying kitties (and 'nocturnal activities'). Many contracts around the country, including the next stage of the M11, and several of the 'DBFO' privately financed schemes have not been tendered yet. <p>
On the face of it, it's looking as if all the time, energy and arrests have been worth it. Despite massive provocation, (to be a bailiff, climber or security guard is basically to be granted a licence to beat people up) the anti-roads movement has (virtually) always responded in a non-violent manner. This has, at times, taken quite phenomenal powers of self control given what has been meted out to us.  At a time such as the end of the first phase at Newbury (seconds away, round two!), it is good to pause and evaluate what we have achieved, and give ourselves a bit of mutual congratulation. ...<br><b> <center>FUCKING WELL DONE EVERYONE!</center></b><p>
*If you want to do anything in the meantime, you might want to ring Under Sheriff Andrew Wilson, overall co-ordinator of Britain's eco-evictions, which he is on record as describing as "All good fun". During working hours he can receive your calls on 01772 823921 (Banks Wilson solicitors, Preston) or 01772 555290 (Sheriff's office, Preston). Alternatively, send a card detailing your gratitude to this great man's house (The Cottage, 483 Garstange Road, Broughton, Preston).<p>
*If your in Brighton this Thursday or Friday get thee to the Richmond for a two day benefit for Newbury - someone has decided to replant some of the trees from Newbury at an as yet undisclosed site and the benefits should help. Friday night Mandragora and Dreadloss DJs + <b>SchNEWS</b> and Conscious Cinema, 10pm-2am �3/�2 concs. Be there - or dont!<p>
* The London Cross-Rail scheme (an underground rail route linking regional lines in the east and west of  London ) was effectively dumped this week.  The project - which has still not made it past the drawing board -has already cost taxpayers �140 million since it was conceived by the 1988 Central Rail Study!

Prison watchdogs have condemned 'battery chicken cells' at Eastwood Park women's prisons in Gloucestershire, which opened in March. Some cells are six foot square, 30 per cent smaller than the minimum size laid down by the Prison Services official standards. No British inmates have been locked up in such a confined space since a Royal Commission in 1878 ordered the demolition of similar cells on the grounds that they were degrading and inhumane. Psychologists, penal reformers and even zoo managers have said such conditions would drive women - and animals - mad. Women at  Eastwood are either on remand awaiting trial or sentenced for non-violent offences.<p>
But while cells shrink in size, the prison population continues to grow. On 21st February the prison population of England and Wales reached an all-time high of 53,000, forcing the Prison Service to declare a 'state of emergency' in 46 prisons, which will have to find space for up to 10% more prisoners each year. The prison population has risen by a quarter since May 1993 when  Michael Howard became Home Secretary.  <p>  
To deal with the demand for prison spaces that his laws have created, Howard has decided to build 40 new prisons. Soon there will be space for all those who are deemed to be 'a threat'. Never mind all the evidence that prisons don't stop crime - that's not the point anyway! As long as there's protesters out there a' protesting and bigots out there a' fuming, you can always rely on the British government to build more of them.

***Ever had to change the times of your early morning protest as no-one will be out of bed in time? Well no fear, France's newest form of protest is for you. No more running across the countryside or screaming your heads off at whoever's close enough to hear, now there's the lie-in. Supporters of France's Association Against Double Summer Time (Ache)  called on all of France to stage a one-day lie-in to mark the twentieth anniversary of clocks going forward instead of staying with Greenwich meantime!<p>***A protest against Labour Party racism  slightly upset Peter Mandelson. He was launching his new book `Can New Labour Deliver' to a crowd of smartly dressed New Labour types, when the protesters asked if  Labour would commit itself to give asylum seekers back their benefits and repeal the Asylum Bill if they get back into power. Erm, actually it seems as if the answer is NO. When the protesters refused to budge Mandelson launched at a female protester holding a  banner - very sophisticated. One protester told <b>SchNEWS</b>, "Hundreds of asylum seekers are already without benefits, soon it's going to be thousands, and Labour just want to keep quiet about it. They're just as racist as the Tories and they can expect a lot more actions like this." Nice one!<p>***The Kings Cross Women's centre in Camden was recently evicted from its premises  by ...wait for it ...a Housing Association. It wanted the centre to pay a commercial rent of �6k pa. Spokesman Mick Sweeney claimed "We do not think it is our job to pay for voluntary organisations" in a recent letter to the local press they attacked the role of the centre for housing political views especially for their lesbian, prostitute, black and sex, race and class support and discussion groups.  The centre took out the first private rape prosecution last year and has been significant in a number of changes in the law on rape. Meanwhile the council who sold the property to the supposed 'community' Housing Association have 105 empty commercial properties, but, claimed that the centre can not have one unless they firstly go through the grants procedures and apply to them for a property at the next meeting.  This is not until June so they have a long time to wait. The women's centre are still determined to carry on with their services. <br>New phone no. <b>0171 624 3577</b>
