<h2>DIG THAT! </h2>
<strong>Sheriff Sore After Seven Day Shafting</strong>
<P><em>"It's the only way to get a voice these days. I feel if I had just written to my MP, would I 
have achieved all this? Would you lot [the assembled media] all be here? I think not."</em><br>
<strong>- Swampy, yesterday</strong>
<P>The last protester along the route of the A30 in Devon emerged from the tunnels at 8:45 p.m. last 
night after a week underground - setting a post-war eviction record.
<P>Fairmile, the last of the three camps on the A30 route to be evicted, was established over two years 
ago (pre-dating Newbury) to block Britain's first private road from being built. Not only does it cover 
more countryside in Tarmac but it's also a symbolic starting point for a disastrous new 
government policy. Swampy, Animal and the now-famous moles didn't put the Earth first for the media 
to focus on their lifestyles, they did it to expose this scandal. So here are the facts:
<P>In 1992 the Chancellor announced a private finance initiative which would give a new lease of life 
to the road building industry. The Design, Build, Finance, Operate (DBFO) scheme was announced. 
This meant that companies who build roads are not paid immediately, but instead after a 30 year 
period are given an undeclared amount based on pre-set shadow tolls. In other words the road builders 
get paid for each vehicle that uses their road. Responsibility is then given to the road builders 
to encourage motorists to use the road - flying in the face of the government's own admission that new 
roads create more traffic. This would be done by sign-posting and by encouraging development along 
the route. Devon County Council has already set aside land along the route for a new town with an 
expected population of 10,000, a technology park, a power station and an extension to an existing 
quarry, effectively extending the urban fringes of Exeter to the east by eight miles. This DBFO scheme, 
dubbed Destroy, Burn, Fell, Obliterate, is the first road of its kind (it's nearest cousin is the Channel 
Tunnel). It's a financial nightmare and one with a dubious safety record. The new roads programme 
means that safety and environmental protection are of little relevance to the private sector profit-
making companies who are responsible for the construction of this and many other roads. And just to 
show they mean business, the Government chose this week to announce the widening (to dual-
carriageway) of <em>another</em> section of the A30. European super-trunk route here we come.
<P>The main problem facing bailiffs were the complex tunnels into which protesters have dug - 
<em>"Built by gypsies with candles"</em>, as the Deputy Under-Sheriff put it on Thursday. 
Meanwhile police have been hassling tunneller's parents for information. But this has been 
countered by devious actions from activists determined not to let the forces of darkness get away with 
the abuse of the planet for profit. Last week the Under Sheriff and his men were woken at 4 a.m. by 
a hoax fire alarm and were forced to wait in the cold car park while the building was subject to an 
intense safety inspection. Another group of activists targeted <em>Balfour Beatty</em>, the company 
who are building the road, by climbing a crane opposite Parliament owned by the company and 
unfurling a banner saying <em>"Privatised Vandalism - stop DBFO roads. We Love You 
Fairmile!"</em> The crane was held for most of the day, and all the crane's occupants were 
arrested for offences including Aggravated Trespass.
<P>The demands made by the protesters include: removal of harsh bail conditions; secrecy behind 
DBFO schemes be dropped; and what's left of the beautiful site is preserved until an unbiased &amp; 
open public inquiry looking at all secret information surrounding the scheme.

<h2>SMUG SELF-CONGRATULATORY BASTARD OF THE WEEK</h2>
<em>"We'll have them out in 24 hours ... I think you'd call it a hat-trick"</em><br>
<strong>- Trevor Coleman, The Under Sheriff of Devon</strong><br>
<P>Employed by the High Court, Under-sheriff Coleman has the satisfying job of evicting travellers 
and gypsies. Usually a solicitor, this man has been hassling people in his spare-time for the past seven 
years. Now he has finally come up against a group of individuals organised enough to keep his bailiffs 
from taking control of any land. If you would like to have a friendly chat with the Under Sheriff call his 
office on 01392 436244.

<h2>Reclaim the Coast</h2>
On 15th Feb '96, heading for the Texaco refinery at Milford Haven in Wales, the Sea Empress oil tanker 
ran aground off Pembrokeshire, spilling 72,000 tonnes of crude oil.
<P>14th-16th Feb sees actions to mark the anniversary - and the oil industry's cover-up. Milford Haven 
Port Authority cut back on safety procedures, whilst Texaco squeezed the tanker into the Haven at low 
tide to save money, then refused to pay any of the clean up costs. The same could happen again.
<P>It's time to hit the earth rapists where it hurts. The UK economy depends on bleeding the Welsh 
coast dry. Most of the coast is a "Special Area of Conservation" (Europe's highest 
conservation legislation) but despite this, Texaco, Elf and Gulf all have refineries in Milford Haven. By 
October full-size oil rigs will be in operation. National Power are now planning to burn Oremulsion, 
"the worlds filthiest oil", at Pembrokeshire Power Station. The "fly ash" from burning is incredibly 
dangerous to the eco-system, and would be catastrophic in the event of a spill - Oremulsion does not 
float on the water surface.
<P>The only way to stop another Sea Empress disaster is to shut down Milford Haven. Direct Action 
to save the Welsh environment is already established with the most high profile campaign being the one 
in response to the devastation from open-cast coal quarrying tearing across the valleys. A massive 
action is planned for the anniversary of the disaster on Sat 15th Feb. A safe camping space will be 
set up the day before. Arrive from noon, Feb 14th for briefing on the issues, safety at oil 
refineries, direct action training, legal briefings etc. There's also a crï¿½che. Details (from 12th Feb): 01749 
812665. Bring very warm clothes and bedding, and waterproofs. If you can't make it to Wales then 
target your local oil industry outlet. See SchNEWS in long for travel info.

<h2>2 years for no crime</h2>
Ejike Emenike, 30, is pastor of <em>The Lord's Anointed Ministry</em>, Lagos. He arrived in Britain 
last February after being beaten and held by Nigerian security forces for denouncing the government 
over the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and many other campaigners. Lying close to death in Rochester 
Prison, Kent, he has been on hunger strike since January 6th and refusing fluids since the 26th.
<P>Although he has now agreed to start accepting rehydration treatment, another 5 refugees are also 
refusing all liquids, and a further 11 are still refusing food. A prison office spokes-person said, 
<em>"We cannot force them to take any water if they have made a rational decision 
of refusal"</em>. Ahem, excuse us, but where does rationality come into it? The Home Office told 
us that a mere 1,295 asylum seekers (at refugee status) were granted entry into the country last year, 
and an estimated 750 refugees are placed in detention centres and jails each year - for committing no 
crime.
<P>They come seeking refuge from military regimes and political persecution. The hunger strikers 
at Rochester come from Nigeria, Russia, Romania, Algeria and Somalia. They left their homelands 
in the face of persecution. They seek refuge in a country completely alien to them, traumatised and 
confused. It's ridiculous that the first thing any refugee would do is to confide in an official...yet one 
of the Asylum Bill's main provisions is to deport refugees back to their home country in 
circumstances where refugee status isn't sought immediately in the first country they reach.
<P>These people have committed, and are accused of, no crime. Yet they are subject to strip searches, 
fingerprinting, and have no access to legal aid. There are long delays in processing their applications. 
Currently 60,000 detainees are awaiting decisions.
<P>Despite Widdicombe's protestation, a spokes-man from the Church's Commission on Racial Justice 
said, <em>"I consider the authorities to be responsible for these men, as there is no need for them to 
have been detained for this amount of time."</em>
<UL>
<LI>Any employer found hiring a refugee with-out a work permit is liable to a &#163;5,000 fine - 
so employers will not consider job applicants that look like they are "illegal immigrants" 
<LI><strong>Michael Howard</strong>'s attitude is rather two-faced in light of his family 
background. Howard's father, Bernat Hecht, was a Romanian Jew, who - thanks to the liberalisation of 
Britain's asylum laws in the late 30s - got out before the Nazis and their Death Camps arrived 
<LI><strong>Banner Theatre</strong> launch a new show on Valentines Day, about the plight of 
asylum seekers under the new Immigration Act. Info: 0121 440 0460 
<LI>On January 18th a vigil was held for animal rights prisoner <strong>Barry Horne</strong>, 
currently on his third week of hunger strike, demanding the government end all links with vivisection 
within 5 years. About 200 supporters attended the vigil at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire, then 
outwitted the police by heading straight for a mice and rat breeding house. One protester said, 
<em>"The supplier of rodents for vivisection was taken aback as people ripped down fencing 
and smashed anything that could be broken. Eventually police reinforcements arrived, so the 
'Tactical Demolition Squad' moved to Hill Grove Farm - a cat breeding house for vivisectors. 15 cats 
were rescued, but police roadblocks later led to 7 arrests and 5 of the cats being taken. The other 10 
have safe new homes."</em>

<LI>A Newbury protester is on Hunger strike demanding a judicial review of the policing of the

Bullingdon, P.O. BOX 50, Bicester, Oxon, OX6 OTR 
<LI>The financial <strong>collapse of Russia</strong> is more than a storm in a D-Cup. Women at

me, you can earn up to 40 per cent more than your salary by selling these items."

respond to the growing consumer pressure to get the hell out. They must be feeling pretty blue... More 
info from the Burma Action Group 0171 359 7679 
<LI>Hundreds of <strong>street vendors</strong> ran amok in the Indonesian capital this week after 
public-order officials drove over the merchandise they had laid out on the roadsides. 500 of 
them looted, set alight the official's cars then burnt down the district chief's three-storey office in 
revenge 
<LI><strong>Zimbabwe's Forestry Commission</strong> has announced that it plans to 
give baboons the Pill - the timber industry is losing "valuable trees" to the voracious creatures. Strange 
considering that Africa's forest are the most depleted on the planet. And why could that be? 'Cos the 
timber industry's chopping down all the trees, of course! 
<LI>A Turkish landlord, determined to out-do Brighton police who recently smashed through the 
wall of a grade II listed building to evict three <strong>squatters</strong>, climbed onto the roof of a 
building brandishing dynamite as a threat to a tenant with qualms about his rent. 
<LI>OK, so their demand - an end to state intervention in the banking world in favour of good 
old <strong>free market capitalism</strong> - leaves us disaffected types somewhat cold, but we'll 
still raise a glass to the 3,300 staff of French bank Credit Foncier de France who took their 
Governor and 10 top executives hostage for six days and festooned the marble pillars of their 
hallowed edifice with cartoons of the French president and finance minister in various stages of 
painful execution! Although the fat cats have now sadly been freed, pin-striped protesters continue to 
occupy the building and for what it's worth, the action has resulted in a government pledge that planned 
bank restructuring will be revised.
<LI>What a surprise - a new report out yesterday by the Round Table Group says that <strong>bus 
de-regulation</strong> has been bad for passengers. Predictably, the Conservatives won't do 
anything, Labour won't say anything - and after their support of the Newbury Bypass the LibDems can 
shut their hypocritical public transport faces. 
<LI>SchNEWS would like to squash rumours  that the Royal yacht Britannia is gonna end up as a 
<strong>prison ship</strong> - and point out that the old Pontin's holiday camp being looked at for a 
jail is the shape of... a liner!

<LI>Protesters from Cyndeithas Yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society), fighting for 
<strong>equality of the Welsh language in Wales</strong>, occupied offices of William Hague, the

<h2>Plane Pane</h2>
Protesters at Manchester Airport objecting to the building of a second runway have squatted trees on 
the route of the new construction. They intend to broaden out direct action campaigning from roads to 
all transport issues. However, after spending six nights being camped 500 yards from 
Manchester's current runway, opponents have had enough of being kept awake by screaming planes 
and are applying to Manchester authorities for a grant to cover the cost of double glazing on their 
treetop homes. One activist said, <em>"After a late night round the camp fire discussing alternative 
strategies for creating jobs in the region, the last thing I need is to be woken up at 6am by a jumbo 
jet."</em>

<h2>and finally</h2>
Last week, in the continuing moral panic debate about ravers, ecstasy and all things associated with 
such devil worshipping, Barry Legg's Private Members Bill went through on the nod. The Bill will give 
police the power to shut down clubs immediately where they suspect drug taking or dealing is taking 
place. Supported by Leah Betts' parents, the Bill will apparently help save young people's lives. On its 
second reading it was unopposed, but still MPs waffled on and on. Why? Well, so they could waffle so 
long that they "talked out" the next scheduled debate - on the Cold Weather payments (Wind Chill 
Factor) Bill. Cold weather payments of &#163;8.50 are issued when the average recorded temperature 
is freezing or below over a seven day period, but takes no account of the wind chill factor, which can 
make things feel a lot colder. Age Concern had hoped the legislation would have benefited nearly 2 
million of the UK's poorest pensioners who face a deadly struggle with the cold every winter. It's 
estimated that winter weather kills up to 50,000 pensioners every year - rather more than any 
ecstasy tablet.

<h2>disclaimer</h2>
The SchNEWS warns all readers not to dig the notion of tunnels. Subterranean living for any length of 
time can leave you truly shafted, and Going Underground can get you in a real Jam. Stay away from 
probing Sheriffs, and ensure that your only contact with moles is with the ones infiltrating your 
meetings.  Then you will feel soiled. Honest.
