<EM>"If voting changed anything, they'd abolish it."</EM><BR>
- Ancient Anarchist Proverb<p>

<EM>"Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on lunch."</EM><BR>
- Anon<p>

<EM>"The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not 
utterly absurd; indeed, in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread 
belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible."</EM><BR>
- Bertrand Russell<P>

<STRONG>With only (!) six weeks to go of non-stop soundbites and inane grins, SchNEWS decided to 
let activists from around the country have their say...</STRONG><p>
"What general election? We're too busy trying to do something useful to faff around with 
such trivia. Tell that John Major to stick it where the sun don't
shine."<BR>
- <EM><a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/resurgence/car2.html"TARGET="new">Manchester's Campaign 
Against Runway 2</a></EM><p>

"Fifty-one of the largest hundred economic bodies worldwide are corporations.  Nobody 
votes them into power, they have no popular mandate; yet they can and do wield enormous 
influence over everybody on the planet.  If this farcical `General Election' shows us 
anything, it highlights the shift in power away from government towards multinationals."<BR>
- <EM><a href="http://www.oneworld.org/cw/" TARGET="new">Corporate Watch</A></EM><P>

"A Green vote in local elections is a positive vote, as Oxford and Brighton have shown, 
but until there is a system of Proportional Representation in this country, a vote for a Green 
candidate in a general election is always going to be a wasted one. At the very least, we 
should be spoiling our ballot papers and running off with the pencil."<BR>
- <EM>Ecotrip<!--KOKO on green party web site?--></EM><P>

"Over the past three years the Tories and Labour have been engaged in a bidding war to 
sell off our privacy. Beginning with the Criminal Justice Act, the Security Services Act and 
the Police Bill, both parties have sung a macabre melody that saw police, MI5 and assorted 
agencies gain more power than any previous previous generation thought possible. 
Jack Straw watched on smiling as towns and cities across the country put their citizens 
under the gaze of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV). He  supported the adoption of 
denouncement campaigns and powerful police surveillance computer checks. New Labour 
spokesman Frank Field is  proposing mandatory DNA fingerprinting at birth. John Major 
agreed to a deal with the FBI for the mass tapping of British phone lines, the gutting of 
data protection law, and the elimination of people's right to encrypt  their  email and 
phone messages. Britain is fast becoming the developed world's leading surveillance 
society, but its key protections are approaching those found in the
third world. Neither of 
the major parties are prepared to sing a different tune. They seem to have forgotten that 
democracy and privacy are inseparable."<BR>
- <EM>Simon Davies, <a href="www.privacy.org/pi/" TARGET="new">Privacy International</a></EM><P>

"This  is our opportunity to show the Tories the Red Card. We will 
challenge all the mainstream, pro-capitalist parties, championing demands 
like �6 an hour minimum wage, shorter working week, abolition of all 
anti-union laws. etc. If elected, our MPs will live on a worker's wage, 
refusing to join the 237 millionaires already infesting parliament."<BR>
- <EM>Richie Venton, <A HREF="http://wkweb1.cableinet.co.uk/diblake/" TARGET="new">
Scottish Socialist Alliance</A></EM><P>

"This election is just as irrelevant as the last one. 200,000 anti-election stickers have gone 
out as well as 100,000 `WANKERS' posters. 10,000 people waving them outside Downing 
Street on the March for Social Justice on April 12th should get the message home."

<strong>- Ian Bone</strong>

PO Box 5, Greenleaf, Colston St, Bristol.<P>

"They say `No Vote No Voice', but by boycotting the election your
action speaks louder than words. By withdrawing your consent you have
more right to criticise, not less. By doing something worthwhile on
May Day, you can cast a vote against the piss-poor inhabitants of
Westminster and their minions, and taking control of their own
life."<BR>

<P>"All three political parties remain committed to
perpetuating the injustices, poverty and environmental destruction
which comes with growth economics. Party politics mirrors consumerism:
it is empty of real content, is packaged in glittering soundbites and
images and tries to persuade us that this is progress. Only the Green
Party has a longer term, sustainable vision of how politics should be
- based around cultural change - but are likely to be ineffective in
our anachronistic electoral system. Ultimately real change must come
from the grass roots, with new agendas, different political and
economic structures and a broader ethical framework which will render
the current political system irrelevant."  <BR>

HOWARD MARKS, renowned cannabis smuggler, is to stand in the Norwich North constituency for 
the Campaign to Legalise Cannabis. He's also standing in Norwich South. Perhaps it's that
short term memory thing...<P>

SCREAMING LORD SUTCH manifesto pledges include abolishing January and February to make the 
winter shorter, dogs to be made to eat fluorescent food to avoid the danger of treading in 
dog's mess at night and banning work before lunchtime `because it's far too difficult.'<P>

RONNIE CARROLL who once sang "Ring-A-Ding-Girl" for Britain in the Eurovision Song Contest,
has launched The Rainbow Connection Dream Ticket Leisure Party, promising to introduce 
electronic voting in every home - giving everyone �300 a week for doing so!  
Spokesman Rainbow George said: "Ronnie is not standing for parliament, he is standing 
against it. In this day and age why do we need people to represent us."
Zippy and Bungle were unavailable for comment.<P>

VOTE FOR THE GOAT A bearded beast stood for mayor in a Mexican town recently. 
The calibre of the other candidates was such that it found itself leading in the polls
until it was poisoned!<P>

KEVIN LIPIAT a 34 year old homeless builder and Newbury veteran, is standing as a 
candidate in St Ives, Cornwall. He took his local council to court winning a landmark
victory giving homeless people the right to vote...but having done so, "I realised there 
wasn't any one I wanted to vote for."

In a purely impartial fashion, we at SchNEWS feel we must report on the views of a member of
 the C of E clergy, the Reverend John Papworth (also editor of Fourth World Review),
 who advocated shoplifting in large superstores on a moral stance. "Supermarkets are 
soulless, and their advertising is propaganda. Shoplifting is a badly needed reallocation 
of resources." We wonder if this would stand up in a court of law?  Don't try this one at
 home, kids!<P>

<STRONG>Sainsbury's</STRONG> are planning to build a new supermarket in the space next to Brighton Railway 
Station, on the site of one the country's biggest car boot sales. The area is also an
 important corridor for city wildlife. Railtrack have rejected a proposition to turn the
 area into a nature trail, citing the dangerous presence of electricity generators and
 access to the railway lines. Obviously, these wouldn't matter if a supermarket was built
 instead. Contact Brighton FoE: 01273 324455.

News from our animal rights correspondent: Supporters of the Chiddingfold Fox Hunt had their
 evening ruined last Friday as 150 protesters made their presence felt at their  annual Hunt
 Ball. A large police presence did not deter activists outside the Arundel hotel from 
expressing their views. Several hunters, looking as terrified as the hunted 
fox itself, turned tail and fled from the barrage of abuse, flour, eggs and rocks that were
 raining down. News over the police radio announced that 13 vehicles (unlucky for some) were
 trashed that evening. Although there were no arrests on the night it's believed that 3
 protesters have since been nicked for criminal damage and violent disorder.  Apart from
 this, a smashing time was had by all.  Hunt Sabs Association: 01273

For carrying a wooden plank. The man was arrested and charged under the Trade Unions and
 Labour Relations Act. Manchester cops, it seems, are trying to put a stop to the protests
 against the proposed second runway by nicking people for anything - then imposing bail 
conditions of a 4 mile exclusion zone around the proposed runway site. The camps are in 
court next week. 0161 834 8221.

After hearing reports of his alleged new romance at Manchester Airport, 
Swampy has declared that his only true love is Mother Earth and no flesh 
and blood women will get in the way of his devotion to protecting the 
environment. "Dear to my heart though Merry is, I cannot allow broken 
hearts to interfere with tunnelling."Poor Merry replied "As Princess Leia
held out for Han Solo, as Lois Lane held out for Superman, I am prepared 
to wait for my hero to join me when the battle is won."  Ahhhhh.

How thoughtful. Because of a new government ban on those villainous chlorofluorocarbons, 
the US Air Force is to refit all its nuclear missiles with new cooling systems which don't 
use CFC's so that on their way to deliver terminal global warming they won't further erode
the ozone layer! The Environmental Protection Agency concedes that it may seem 'ironic' to
make nuclear missiles more eco-friendly. But regulations is regulations.

really make a difference. Never, ever do it again. Always use your cross wisely - enlist
