<CENTER><B>"Without stringent guidelines to restrict the use of identity cards, a voluntary card will swiftly become compulsory in all but name. As a result everyday activities such as cashing a cheque, buying cigarettes or alcohol or even travelling on public transport will become progressively more problematic for citizens who do not choose to obtain and carry an identity card." </B><BR>
Adrian Beck, Institute of Public Order, Leicester University.</CENTER><P>

What would you spend �15 on? A week's shopping perhaps. That shirt you've had your eye on? Well, if Michael Howard has his way, you'll be spending it on a bright, shiny new... ID card. This week the go-ahead has been given for the introduction of the cards, something which SchNEWS has commented on (and against) for many months. Forget the flag debate smoke screen on whether the Union Jack should be displayed on it or not. A compulsory scheme has been ruled out in name but that's what a voluntary scheme would be in practice. Seven countries in Europe operate a compulsory scheme (in Portugal cards have on the a photo graph, a fingerprint, details of marital status and height, and require a PIN number for their use. They have to be shown to police, governments officials, customs officers, doctors, private security guards and in post offices.)<P> Five countries operate a voluntary scheme, but even with these there is a degree of obligation to possess and carry the card as failing to do so can make life difficult. In France the police have the power to ask for proof of identification in any circumstance. If a person refuses or is unable to produce this, it is perfectly legal to take the individual down the station and detain them for up to six hours while identity is established. In Holland this questioning can be held for up to twelve hours, and a fine may also be charged. This could have important repercussions for protest situations and for groups in society who are not at the top of the cop's Christmas card list.<P>
There is also the danger of 'functional creep', where a card is required for more and more purposes. The police, retailers and banks all favour this (semi) voluntary scheme, but, to paraphrase Christine Keeler, they would, wouldn't they? It seems as if in many ways the proposals which are to be put before Parliament this Autumn are even more menacing than a compulsory scheme, which would at least give the opportunity for instances of direct civil disobedience. This way it will merely be a case of creeping civil inconvenience, leading to a largely universal uptake. <P>
From a basic human rights angle, we are who we are, and we should not have to supply personal details to some stroppy Big Brother figure just because the party line is for us to toe the line. ID cards smack of coerced conformity, a decreasing right to live life as one likes, a decrease in identity even. In these days of the 'free' market, we are becoming more constricted than ever. The advent of the cards means yet another layer of people in society to 'curtain twitch' on our lives. It's time to put up the shutters. We're not ones to condone overt consumerism, but you know you really do like that shirt that caught your eye...<P>
**Frank Field, the 'Labour' (surely not) MP has recommended that every adult be given a smart card encoded with a DNA fingerprint to make the National Insurance system more secure. <P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>CS GAS</B></FONT><P>

<B>"CS spray takes us one step further away from policing by consent rather than coercion...confidence is more likely to be both secured and enhanced by policing methods which respect people's civil liberties and which uphold human rights standards, than by arming the police with a 'quick fix' solution based on secretive and muddled research"</B><BR>Liz Parratt of Liberty.</CENTER><P>
	This week Micheal Howard has given the go ahead for nation-wide usage of CS gas after nearly six months of trials. He claimed that the deterrent is "effective and safe."<P>
	So far CS gas has been used on 582 occasions in five months and drawn, but not used, 350 times. That means that people have been sprayed nearly 4 times a day since the trials began (trigger happy or wot!?). Allegedly only 5 people have been taken to hospital, but that figure does not take into account that anyone who is sprayed must be seen by the police doctor.<P>
	The spray (which is not a gas, but in fact a crystalline solid) has a range of 8 to 14 feet.  CS causes streaming eyes and nose, eyelid spasm, salivation and a burning sensation in the throat and nose.  It also causes severe coughing and chest tightening that leads to impaired breathing.  These effects could be very serious for the 20% of the population that suffer asthma or other respiratory complaints.
	Liberty has received reports of 2 incidents where the ACPO guidelines have clearly been breached. 1) The death of Ibrahima Sey in police custody after being sprayed with CS while handcuffed. 2) In March, 20 people were sprayed with CS inside a coach, following a scuffle outside a night-club in Merseyside; they are now taking civil action against the police.<P>
	The gas has been hastily approved without testing less harmful deterrents, without testing long-term medical effects, and before the outcome of the trial concerning the death of Ibrahima Sey.  Due to the above concerns, two forces, Hertfordshire and Surrey, have decided against implementation of the approved version of CS gas. Hertfordshire's Chief Constable, Peter Sharpe, said "I still have concerns over the safety of the delivery agent and the issue of cross contamination with the use of CS spray".<P>
	The family of Ibrahima Sey are also upset about the decision. Mr Sey's cousin, Kura Nije, claims that the spray is five times stronger than that used in the U.S.  She said "Someone has died in custody and CS was used. How do they know it's safe to use? You could spray someone who's got asthma. It's crazy."

Dickon Walker, 22, who set fire to a petrol bomb next to a bus of Newbury protesters last November, has been cleared of attempted arson and endangering life. He told the jury, "We made some petrol bombs. I honestly don't know how we got to making petrol bombs. It's a mystery to me. The intention was a harmless drunken prank." The Third Battle of Newbury said, " How can a man walk free having admitted his part in a firebomb attack, while peaceful protesters are being sentenced for sitting down on public footpaths or dressing up as a pantomime cow?"

<a name=ARTICLE3><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>THE SOLUTION TO POLLUTION...</H3><p>
<B>"Pollution has a long history...In earlier societies it is possible to find evidence of the many features which characterise the response to contemporary pollution: fatalistic acceptance of the pollution as an inevitable consequence of human activities; a lack of foresight; a preference for short term fixes and a failure for individuals or companies to take responsibilities for their actions."</B><BR>

This week, Environment Minister John Gummer told local authorities that they were responsible for cutting air pollution levels...but hasn't given them any extra dosh to do anything about it. 
The onus is on local authorities to implement measures that will reduce air pollution, primarily from car exhausts. Recommendations include traffic monitoring teams, who will issue on-the-spot fines to car owners.  The target date for the initiative is 2005...a bit too late for the 77,500 who will die by this time prematurely because of tiny particles emitted by vehicle exhausts. <P>
Despite the absolute lack of cash injection by the Government into the initiative, various local authorities are already experimenting with less polluting forms of transport. Ipswich councillors have the use of two electric cars, while their mayor has the option of using natural gas for short car journeys. The town also boasts a gas powered bus and litter cleaning machine. Coventry city council is to conduct trials of an electric car, and Camden Community Transport is using three electric and three natural gas mini-buses.
Gummer says, "The motor car is a good thing in life, it's now got to learn to be a clean thing." 
SchNEWS says, "The motorcar kills 25 people a day from the effects of pollution. Drivers have to reduce their reliance on cars."<P>
Last week, World Health Organisation figures for ozone was exceeded in all British cities and large towns last week.
Ralph Ryder, co-ordinator of Communities Against Toxics, said of the changes.
"The regulatory system has not yet caught up with hormone disrupting chemicals, and consequently does not take them into consideration. It remains to be seen when the government will acknowledge the danger and how it will regulate them."<P>
The situation has become so severe that even the government sees that something should be done, and is very slowly, reluctantly putting the blame onto the car. This is a wrong headed approach, as it gives individuals (car drivers) a guilt trip when they are not given viable alternatives in getting from A to B. Industry should shoulder a lot more of the responsibility. After all, it is corporations not individuals which make the cars after all, and many more noxious contraptions besides. <P>
* In Mexico City in 1988, there were 312 days of severe smog. In early 1989 school children had to be kept at home for a month because of high pollution levels.<P>
* Reports suggest that the Salisbury by-pass is expected to cost twice the forecast amount. After the projected costs of protests and sabotage are taken into consideration, it looks like being one bloody expensive stretch of road! (The energy required in building a road is three and a half times greater than the equivalent length of railway, and uses four times more land.)<P>
* Controversy in Europe is surrounding attempts to get funding for 14 Trans-European Network highways. Suggestions include cutting the budgets of 'non-priority projects' such as culture, education and training, energy and the environment. A decision is expected at a meeting in Dublin on September 20.

The Birmingham RTS was a great success, with 500 people enjoying a car-free carnival. Birmingham police were more than a tad nervous that the road might be dug up, so they arrested one person for conspiracy to commit Criminal Damage. The charge was changed it to Section 18 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act as they knew of no-one he was conspiring with! Eight officers then raided his flat, but then got stuck in the lift on the way down, and had to smash their way out. Upon being released without charge, the innocent party-goer is now suing the police for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment, assault, invasion of privacy and defamation of character. He is also urging the council to sue for the damage done to their lift.<P> 
* Brighton RTS this Saturday. Meet Churchill Square 1pm. <P>
* Compare and contrast these consecutive front-page headlines: WARNING FOR ROAD BLOCKERS: Outcry at protest that could gridlock Brighton (and the following day ...)

The houses on Methley Drive, Leeds have no gardens, but for a couple of days last week Methley Drive became a garden. Turfed from kerb to kerb, the street was the scene of the Methley's Olympics, which included an egg and spoon race. There was also an opportunity for much chilling. "I'd like the grass to be permanent", said one resident of 38 years standing. "That's what we like, a bit of greenery. We thought this road plan would be impossible, but they've proved us wrong. They've done a good job." And who are 'they', you might well ask? Baby-eating anarchos? Terrorists intent on destroying society perhaps? No, it's Transport 2000, who launched their Streets for People campaign at Methley. Curiously, there was not a riot cop in sight. 
<P>
* Saturday 17th saw Walker Street in Bath become a car-free party zone for four hours, and it seems that the police were well behaved. Well done! There will be another in the city in October.

On Sunday and Monday, Brighton claimants will embark on a two day hunger strike to demonstrate the dietary effects of 100% cut in benefit, brought about by the Job Seekers Allowance (JSA). 'A' day (Oct 7th), when the JSA is to be launched, is only SEVEN weeks away. ES workers have been issued with memos telling them how to fob claimants off with crap information even though the JSA threatens up to 30% job cuts for ES employees.
'Wage Slavery or Starvation' T-Shirts are available from Nottingham Campaign Against the JSA, PO Box 192, Nottingham.<P>
National contact: Claimants Action Group, c/o O.U.W.C.U.; East Oxford Community Centre, Princes Street, Oxford OX4 1HU. Tel: 01865 723750.
Sat 7th Sept: Demo against the JSA. Assemble Shepherds Bush Green, W London 12 noon.

"Visit the new earth galleries. An earth shattering experience." So goes the blurb for the new exhibit of the Natural History Museum. Nothing so unusual about that, until that is, you look at who the primary sponsors are: RTZ, responsible for earth shattering projects around the globe, yet have very little to do with anything 'natural.' The Natural History Museum told SchNEWS, "We don't have any conflict with the interests of RTZ." Of course not, especially after having received �1m in sponsorship from the mining company.<p>

SchNEWS extends a welcoming hand to Britain's newest - and perhaps strangest pressure group. 'Trolleys in Distress UK' have been set up to highlight a 'mass cruelty which occurs in our streets daily'... the 'abuse, neglect and slavery of millions of defenceless shopping trolleys, not forgetting baskets'. They continue in a similar vein: 'The time has come for drastic action, we have a member who has already released many trollies back to the wild.<P>
Are these people a loaf short of a bag of groceries? Basket cases? Off their trollies? Or are they their ideas up the right aisle.
