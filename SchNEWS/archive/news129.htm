<h2>
<A NAME="Heading1">WHICH EYESORE? </A></h2>

<em>"Trident... what the bloody hell is it for?" <STRONG>- </STRONG></em><STRONG>Field 
Marshall
Lord Carver</STRONG><p>
<p>
Faslane Peace Camp has been watching the Clyde submarine base, home of
Britain's nuclear weapons, for fifteen years. Now the new local council want to
evict it. It is argued that the camp, a collection of painted caravans, tents,
and benders, is an eyesore. The dozens of local people visiting with support
and donations every day would argue that the eyesore lies just a few hundred
yards up the side of the loch.<p>
<em></em><p>
<em>"You're travelling around the loch and you notice what looks like a huge
battleship with cranes and searchlights. Then you see the cameras, every
few feet, and the miles of razor wire in triple-thickness rolls. You might
notice the dogs, and the police with machine-guns. But when you come around
the back of the base, and look down from what ought to be a classically
beautiful Scottish valley, you see the Trident shed. It's big, and menacing
enough to ruin the view. But when you know what it contains and what that
means - well, when I show people they usually cry."</em> - <STRONG>Faslane Peace
Camper</STRONG>


<h3>
<A NAME="Heading2">Social Spending? Nah.</A></h3>

<p>
The Trident programme costs [sterling]30 billion - the shed it lives in alone
cost [sterling]800 million over budget.. This in a country where 70% of people
are opposed to nuclear weapons, and with a New Labour election manifesto
promising to improve quality of life - not to mention promising "prevention of
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction"  and "a new momentum on arms
control and disarmament."<p>
But the real cost of nuclear weapons is in the kids with leukaemia around
nuclear `power' stations - most of which are just factories for the ingredients
of nuclear bombs. And that's a global problem - more and more countries are
rushing to develop their own nukes. Hardly surprising since Trident's post-Cold
War role is to float around keeping an eye on `potential insurgency' in `third
world dictatorships'. They've even developed a concrete missile, to use as a
macabre warning shot.<p>


<h3>
<A NAME="Heading3">Eviction Action!</A></h3>

In the last few weeks Faslane has started to swell at the edges as more and
more people come back to help defend. For fifteen years it's been a sorted
place to live and good campaign forum, but now it needs defences to beat a
potential eviction.<p>
The new local council are just flexing their right-wing muscles - pigheadedly
refusing to debate the eviction, even after a petition containing 2,500
signatures was handed to them. But with the niggling concern that their budget
does actually have better places to go, such as schools and housing,  they've
admitted they can't afford a "Manchester-style eviction". So who you gonna
call?<p>
Work has begun on tunnels, lock-ons and tree-houses, and one resident has even
set up his entire caravan as his lock-on. Scaffolding and other tat is still
badly needed, though (please note, all you people with vans!) and of course
bodies arriving with moral support are always welcome. There is communal space
at the camp, although it tends to fill up so bring a tent or be ready to get
bender-ing!<p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading4">Nagasaki Anniversary</A></h3>

<p>
This weekend - the 52nd anniversary of the first aggressive use of a nuclear
bomb by the US against Japan - sees co-ordinated campaigns against Trident at
sites of crime throughout Europe and the USA.<p>
Youth CND are running a peace camp at Aldermaston bomb factory this weekend,
and at Faslane, events will be tied in with the event to evict the camp. A
rally at 1pm will be followed by a boat trip and... other events!<p>

<A NAME="Heading6">Windmill Hill Fur Farm</A></h2>

<p>
<em>"Behind the quasi-glamorous world of fur lies this stinking, putrid scumbag-
infested hellhole of abhorrent cruelty called Windmill Farm."<STRONG> -
</STRONG></em><STRONG>Un-named animal rights activist</STRONG><p>
<STRONG> </STRONG><p>
40 Animal Rights protesters gathered outside the Dorset premises of T.T. Smith,
Britain's most notorious and barbaric fur farmers, last week in the first of a
series of protests that have they have vowed to continue until the place is
shut down. The farm, one of 13 in the UK, in Child Okeford near Blandford,
houses hundreds of mink in appalling, stinking conditions. One protester told
SchNEWS: "Mink are solitary creatures living in a territory of up to two
kilometres whereas on this farm they are kept in tiny cages without any water
to swim in. They live cruel, short lives and display signs of madness."   <p>
Protesters turned up at the farm to find it guarded by a horde of meat-headed
village idiots employed as `security', and requests to see the owner were met
with refusals and threats, before one 26-year old activist, attempting to video
proceedings, was assaulted. "A man struck me with a large PVC bar, which
narrowly missed my eye. It was totally unnecessary; we were trying to carry out
a peaceful protest."   <p>
The cops arrested a 43-year old man in connection with the attack and bailed
him until September pending enquiries. The `security' later drove at speed
through the crowd, narrowly missing protesters who were forced to dive out of
the way and the threats and intimidation carried on later outside a local pub.
The protest, timed to coincide with National Anti-Fur day, comes in the wake of
rumoured links between the farm and a local beauty parlour and extensive media
coverage highlighting  the horrific conditions. <p>
When the ball started rolling at Consort it led quickly to the kennel's
closure, T.T. Smith could be the next to go.  "Some of the staff said we'd be
dead if we came back and protested again. The farm is stinking and the animals
are kept in terrible conditions, and we won't stop until something is done."<p>

<ul>
<li> Meet on Sunday Aug 31 @ 12 Noon outside the farm, speaker from
Respect For Animals.<p>

<li> SchNEWS urges readers not to bombard T.T. Smith, Holdway House,
Shaftesbury Rd, Child Okeford, Dorset (Tel: 01258 860732) with junk

<li> Native American Leonard Peltier, a Chippewa/Lakota activist and
important member of the American Indian Movement, was jailed in 1976
for the deaths of two FBI agents. Peltier was involved in the movement
to protect the Black Hills area of South Dakota against uranium mining
when a fire fight occurred between the FBI and activists on the Pine
ridge reservation. Two FBI and one Lakota were killed. The death of
the Lakota man was never investigated. There is no direct evidence
that Peltier is guilty, in fact extensive trawling of FBI files have
only revealed that the case against Peltier is based on perjury,
mental torture, coercion of witnesses, fabrication of the murder
weapon and the withholding of evidence. Peltier remains in prison,
guilty of only protecting the land and its people. Contact:
International Leonard Peltier Defence Committee, c/o Lesley Worrall,
140 Gramoyle Road, Liverpool L15 5AD (enclose SAE)<p>

<li> Remember where your smoke comes from. Keith Lyons and Belinda
Sims are both doing five years in a Moroccan jail with no chance of
parole for smuggling 125kg of hash. Conditions in Moroccan jails are
hideous, prisoners have to pay for food, blankets and even
accommodation (!). Keith was tortured for three days in an attempt to
get him to reveal information. Please send books, mags, money or even
just letters of support: Keith Lyons (73702) and Belinda Sims (73703),

<li> Ray Gilbert and John Kamara were sentenced to life for the murder
of John Suffield, a betting shop manager, in December 1981. None of
the eye witnesses could pick out Gilbert from an ID parade; no
forensic evidence links the pair to the crime; uncorroborated evidence
was used in prosecution; TWO juries were dismissed during the trial;
Defence witnesses were interfered with; custody records were destroyed
and deals were made with the police and remand prisoners for
testifying against Ray. On prosecution witness admitted that his
evidence was fabricated, yet it took the Home Office seven years to
conduct an inquiry.  Gilbert is not allowed to talk to the press about
his case - in contravention of established case law. Write to Ray

<A NAME="Heading10">Ashton Court Park to Die?</A></h2>

<p>
20 acres of Ashton Court, a public park on the western edge of Bristol, has
been leased by the city council to Pioneer Aggregates - an Australian
multi-national - in order that they can expand Durnford Quarry. A beautiful
wildflower meadow - home to a wide diversity of plants including Scabious,
orchids and adders tongue fern - will be replaced with a 100 metre deep hole.
Calls for a public enquiry have been declined by John Prescott. A local
resident told SchNEWS, "We are deeply disappointed that such a wonderful place
could be lost." <p>
Get down there for some fun on 26th August when locals will show Pioneer the
same due respect that the Oz multi-national has shown the residents of
Bristol.<p>

<A NAME="Heading11">Watching YOU</A></h2>

<p>
The Metropolitan Police are planning to install a dense web of spy cameras
covering their entire area of jurisdiction following the success of trial
schemes in the Square Mile of the city. The cameras use the Automatic Number
Plate Recognition system, which reads the reg. plates of every single vehicle
passing and checks them instantly with the Police National Computer- and then
alerts the control room with a beep and a screen message when it comes across
anyone it considers `dodgy'- and we all know the broad potential of that
definition. The City set-up, instigated in February, has already led to over
1000 police actions. As Commissioner Condon says, this system will `detect and
prevent many different crimes and help us protect the people of London against
the ever present terrorist threat.' Hmmmm........<p>

A cop- bashin' boxer dog named Floyd gets a special SchNEWS pet rosette this
week after trapping two terror- stricken WPC's in their car (appropriately a
Rover) in Uttoxeter, Staffs. Called to investigate reports of a canine
attacking a horse, the coppers ended up cowering as the hate-fuelled hound
turned on the more deserving target, finishing the job off stylishly by eating
three of their tyres. <p>
And as if CCTV madness wasn't over-the-top enough in the real world, management
at a model village in Ramsgate, Kent are installing the much-loved spy cameras
in their miniature streets after naughty tourists have indulged in pilfering
