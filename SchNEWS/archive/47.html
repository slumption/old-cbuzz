<p>
The spark of the largest grassroots direct action movement in a decade, the  Criminal Justice Act, is one year old. Happy anniversary. Other struggles come and go, but the fight against Michael Howard's little crowd-pleaser has become a fight for our very own cultural identity.  Now that our  skin and bones  have effectively  become the front line in the war  on political and social dissent, the choice of whether or not to stand and fight is arbitrary. <p>
Justice?, like most of the anti-CJA groups, no doubt reached its zenith just before the Bill became law and it's doubtful we'll ever reach those dizzy heights again .
But was it ever just about the CJA?  Wasn't it about bringing people together at places like the Courthouse, Justice?'s most successful squatted community centre?  This not only acted as a springboard for SchNEWS, Conscious Cinema and a million other dreams and ventures, but got people off their arses, thinking about things for the first time, doing things they would normally never do, talking to people they'd never usually talk to.  Showing  just what we can achieve without the politicians and bureaucrats  - creating a so-called DiY culture, but a culture which always seems to flourish when people are under threat or in struggle.  <p>
And is Justice? really about getting the CJA repealed - end of story?  Please write to your MP and sign our petition ... we don't think so. <p>
As political parties lurch further to the right the vacuum  becomes ever more clearer for us to fill.  Direct action gets results but it isn't just about being against things.  It shouldn't just be about single issues but challenging the whole way society  runs: <p> 
<center><b>* anti-roadbuilding action is now about reclaiming our streets and highlighting the need to end the 'tyranny of the motorcar'<p>
* saying no to out of town shopping centres and endless consumer crap is about growing your own veg <p> 
* living in a vehicle or  bender is about low-impact lifestyles<p>
* squatting is about recycling the empties<p>
* producing our own newsletters and videos is about writing what we think - not what people think about us<p>
* free parties is about saying no to crap clubs with rip-off prices and numbskull bouncers</b></center><p>
And all of this about having fun, being yourself and breaking out of the work-consume-die mentality that is killing the planet. So what of the future?  One year on, there is a vision, a mushrooming of positive solutions.  We need to work towards sustainable lifestyles as well as fighting back.<p> <center><font size=  +2 ><b>What do you think?<p>  And more importantly, what are you doing about it? </b></font></center>

Merseyside is seeing an escalating wave of industrial action.  In the last few months 
dockers, fire-fighters and residential care-workers have taken industrial action over worsening terms and conditions at work.<p>Nearly 500 dockers are entering their fifth week on strike. The Port Authorities who made a tidy 35 million last year have been trying to smash the unions power  for some time.  They  want a seven-day week, three-shift day with no union recognition!  The 'wildcat' strikers - triggered by an almost random sacking of five workers -have had no money, no official backing from their union and so no strike pay.  However, they have organised themselves so that hundreds turn out for regular mass meetings and rotas ensure pickets at six gates into the docks 24 hours a day.<p>In October all 500 sacked workers attempted to return to work with signed legal documents drawn up by the Transport and General Workers Union  (TGWU) but were met with a massive police presence who threatened them with the new 'illegal trespass' laws. However under an 1848 by-law dockers are allowed to go into the docks as far as the water - so the police then changed their tune and said it was 'unsafe' to enter with such a large crowd!  <p><center>They are in urgent need of donations.  Please send cash and letters of support to:<br> <b>Jimmy Davies, secretary, Port Stewards, TGWU, Transport House, 37 Islington, Liverpool 3 <br>  Tel 0151 207 3388 </b></center>

If you thought peaceful protest was being stamped on, and letter writing from the comfort of your own home (if you've got one) was a safer bet - think again.<p>  Now even complaining in writing could see you in court !    Five people who wrote to Sandown race-course to urge the cancellation of  the COPEX 95 arms fair are to be sued for libel.  Each had ignored solicitors letters demanding they apologise to COPEX and pay ï¿½176 legal costs.  Eight people from Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) who  triggered the letter- writing campaign by calling the fair a 'marketplace for electroshock batons and other torture equipment'  have also been issued writs.  In fact the organisers COPEX have been dishing out writs like confetti at a wedding.  GreenLine magazine (who just copied CAAT's leaflet and are desperate for a very cheap solicitor  01726 850500 )  the National Peace Council (who've had to apologise twice), Peace News (publishing a short article  on the NPC apology!), the Peace Pledge Union , Sporting Life and the News and Mail have all had solicitors letters landing on their doormats. <p>
However, there's been no indication that COPEX will take libel action against the makers of award- winning documentary 'The Torture Trial'  shown recently on  Channel 4 .  It identified some companies represented at COPEX 94  as prepared to sell electroshock devices and leg shackles, both of which are illegal in the UK. COPEX describe their  show as  the "definitive showcase of internal security, counter insurgency and special operations equipment and services"  but with countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Israel, China, Columbia, and Algeria having a good sniff around at COPEX 94  - many of whom Amnesty International regard as states which systematically practice torture - you wonder what these nice 'equipment and services' will be used for? Still if there's money to be made....<p>
So why the paranoia?  It seems COPEX want to head off a similar campaign that happened this year in Germany, when one of their shows was cancelled just four days before it was due to begin because of pressure from local peace and human rights action groups.<p>
*  Undeterred by the writs CAAT went ahead with a non-violent blockade of this weeks  arms fair.   60 people closed the site for couple of hours with repeated invasions of the site. <br> <center><b>CAAT  0171 281 0297 </b></center>

<p>
On Tuesday Ken Saro-Wiwa, one of the main activists against Shell Oil's destruction  of the Ogoni Lands in Nigeria, was given a death sentence.<p>
The Ogoni land, is one of the most polluted places on the planet, with fountains of oil pouring into villagers' fields, contaminated water, leaking pipelines, pools of sulphur and drainage problems.  Shell were allowed to do this because oil is Nigeria's biggest commodity.  It accounts for 90% of its national revenue and 50% of the oil extracted is by Shell.  Kens brother, Dr Owens Saro-Wiwa said "The land is so devastated environmentally that fishermen and farmers cannot sustain their lives."  The Ogoni are forced to import goods to live.  They have no choice but to take direct action to save their land and their whole way of life.<p>
Ken belongs to the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), who began a campaign against the destruction and complete burnout of their land 5 years ago.  Their aim was to force the oil giants to repair the environmental damage done and to increase the share of the oil revenues to the 500,000 Ogoni people.  MOSOP's continual protests eventually forced Shell to halt its operations in the middle of 1993.  The  demonstrations continued and the Nigerian millitary began using mobile 'kill and go' police to attack them.  Ken was framed for the murder of four Ogoni - two of whom were his in-laws and another two who were his close friends.  It was alleged that he did it because they sold out to the millitary but the trial was purely politically motivated and the millitary used bribery and harassment to deter witnesses for Ken.<p>  
Now he faces death - a verdict condemned by Amnesty International and other human rights groups and people from all over the world.   When news reached England 35 Reclaim the Streeters getting nowhere outside the motor show, invaded the Nigerian Embassy  smashing windows, pouring red paint everywhere and doing a banner drop.  There were 16 arrests under the Public Order Act. <p>

<a name=ARTICLE6><HR width=80% size=3><H3><center>MAJOR HEADACHE</center></H3><p>
Over 500 hundred protesters invaded Chequers on Sunday, in protest at continued French nuclear testing.  Chirac arrived at the prime ministers country retreat that evening for "dinner and a summit" with John Major.  12 people got arrested under section 14 of the CJA: "refusing to comply with an order".  One of the arrested was wearing a John Major mask and said "I'm sure that's why the police were so rough".  A couple of people were taken to hospital with minor injuries.<p>
One eye witness described the scene as "wonderful, colourful, angry chaos!" as 150 police, many on horseback, struggled to round up protesters , who were spread all over the field in front of the house.<p>
France's 3rd nuclear test took place the previous Friday at Mururoa, 11pm Paris time.  The French defence Ministry said the blast was equal to about 60,000 tons of TNT.  "This test was aimed at guaranteeing the reliability and safety of weapons in the future".  The safety and reliability of the atoll itself is still under debate.<p>
Meanwhile people are still disgusted with Chirac's hypocrisy for suggesting that the Pacific become a nuclear free zone after this round of tests.  "Its not just that they're not clearing up after themselves" said Hannah Rohan of Youth CND, "but they're not even going to stop developing nukes.  These tests are to give them the data to design them with computers - meaning that they can still increase their nuclear arsenals without the unwelcome attention that nuclear tests bring."<p>
Major Facts: (1) The Britsh Prime Minister is the only commonwealth leader not to condemn the tests. France wouldn't have dared to carry out a test on the eve of a visit to any other country but he knew he could rely on Major's support. (2) He has openly said that he doesn't think Chirac has a choice and he likes using words like "responsible", "safe", "reliable" and "scientific" in sentences that also contain the word "nuclear".<p>
* Environment Secretary John Gummer  was left sitting on his own at the first International Children's Conference in Eastbourne last week. All the other delegates stood up when asked if they were against the Fench Nuke tests.<br><center><b>24-hr CND line: 0171 700 2393 </b></center>

*** Joy for the people of Brightlingsea where Roger Mills -  the man who brought live animal exports to the town -  has temporarily stop trading .   Next Wednesday he goes to the High Court where his business should hopefully be wound up.  Pissed off lorry drivers, fed up with losing so much money finally pulled the plug on the man triggering off all-round celebrations.  This Saturday there's a party at the local community centre and everyone is  welcome, except perhaps Mills. Accomodation available ring BALE 01206 304241<p>*** Michael Heseltine's new electronic desk diary cost ï¿½150, 000 to put in and will cost ï¿½10,000 a year to run.  Bargain <p>***The McLibel trial continues and some recent stories from the trial are burgers sold partly cooked, kitchens with 2 inches of raw sewage on the floor, racist, sexist, and homophobic treatment of staff.  It was 3 years last month since a McD's employee was electrocuted while at work in a Manchester outlet.  The trial continues  0171 713 1269<p> ***Lambeth council are getting a bit hassled with squatters who are refusing to move out of a block of 182 flats that they are waiting to demolish for 'redevelopment'.  More and more people are moving in every day and they are starting to use the CJA to try and get rid of them.<p>***The post office apologised in a newspaper article for late delivery of letters with addresses written in Gaelic.  Apparently the new technological gadgetry that sorts out the mail finds it illogical and the computer doesn't understand.  Maybe activists, paranoid about surveillance cameras, DNA databases and other techno crap should consider taking a Gaelic lingo course.<p>***A 59 year old bloke from Worthing, who has spent months trying to get a response for his claim for incapacity benefit, supergled himself to a desk at the benefits agency.  His acute back problems made him take early retirement but even after his extreme action all he got was some leaflets on making claims (and a mention in the SchNEWS).<p>***11 people are up in court this week after a demo on Climate Action Day at Hope Street in Glasgow (Britain's most polluted street).  The 1st day got adjourned because the court couldn't find a video machine or tape player anywhere in Glasgow to show the evidence!<p>*** Gridlock in Lancaster as Critical Mass caused the biggest snarl up there for Donkeys years.....

THE NIGHT OF THE BONFIRE BOYS:<br>
"In both Rye and Guildford policemen were thrown onto bonfires by angry mobs. The Rye Bonfire Boys gained extra notoriety for themselves when they set fire to the Mayor's private yacht, dragged it out of the harbour and left it, burning, outside the Town Hall. 
Increased police manpower from the 1880s onwards, coupled with various political and social reforms, led to a decline in Bonfire Boy activity. Yet although the last serious rioting took place in Lewes in 1904, violent scuffles between youthful mobs and the police took place in Sussex as recently as 1959. All of which suggests that although times change, the idea that there once existed a trouble-free golden age of law and order is, in all probability, a myth."<br> So put that in your arse and light it, Mr Howard.
