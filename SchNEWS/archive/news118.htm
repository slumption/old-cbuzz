<A NAME="search">PUBIC ENEMY NO. ONE</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;Now is the time to act.  The right of privacy of
individuals needs to be guaranteed before all power passes to those who own the
tools of surveilance.&quot;</em><br>
<strong>- Editorial, New Scientist, April</strong><p>
<strong></strong>An American company has developed spy cameras with the
technology to strip people of their clothes, leading privacy campaigners to dub
the invention <em>PubeMaster 2000</em>.<p>
In April, the US Federal Aviation Authority provided $26m to speed up research
in the new surveillance technologies, principally for advance body search for
airport surveillance. The system doesn't use X-ray; it recreates the human form
from digitised analysis of thermal and density data.<p>
One image has been released by the US government as part of a package designed
to show it's cracking down on terrorist threats. It shows a naked man with
clearly visible secreted objects such as &quot;75gm of simulated cocaine taped
to the abdomen&quot; and &quot;25mm thick plexiglass knife.&quot; BodySearch TM
has been in the development stage for 4 years and is now being used in
trials.<p>
Simon Davies of Privacy International, argues that <em>&quot;as sure as night
follows day&quot;</em> this technology will be adapted for much wider use<em>.
&quot;BodySearch is the leading edge&quot;</em>, he told SchNEWS, prediciting,
<em>&quot;it will be common technology, general purpose in the urban
environment within ten years.&quot;</em><p>
The cameras are already intruding into our private lives. Diana Sampson, who
monitors CCTV for the London Borough of Sutton says, <em>&quot;I know for a
fact that one leisure centre has cameras in its women's changing room,
monitored by men and they can do anything with those tapes</em>.&quot; CCTV is
a honey pot for perverts. One camera operator in Mid Glamorgan has been
convicted on more than 200 counts of using cameras to spy on women, and making
obscene phone calls from the control room.<p>
<em>&quot;Through urban design you strip away any hope that people may be able
to escape the gaze of the cameras,  says Davies, author of Big Brother:
Britains Web of Surveillance.And through powerful technology you strip away
their clothes. So in the end there's nothing left but threadbare civil
liberties...and no clothes.&quot;</em><p>
Even more alarming  are the technologies already in place in Britain. These
include computerised face recognition systems that can automatically compare
faces captured on CCTV, infra-red radar systems able to detect activity behind
walls and in darkness, and miniature devices designed for covert surveillance.
125,000 of these devices, as small as a matchbox, are sold each year from UK
and can be picked up from as little as 60. The biggest market is keeping tabs
on employees. The range of objects in which tiny cameras can be hidden means
that they raise <em>&quot;absolutely no suspicion whatsoever.&quot;</em><p>
The March edition of the industry magazine 'CCTV Today' reveals what we can
expect next. Not only will we be seen, but heard. Audio in CCTV is an area of
<em>&quot;exciting potential&quot;</em> says Julian Sharples, Managing Director
of GEB Europe.<p>
In their Codes of Practice, Sussex Police state that <em>&quot;no sound
facility should be provided with any public CCTV system&quot;</em>, but these
are guidelines only. The camera industry itself is lawless. <p>
As Simon Davies points out, <em>&quot;Anyone can set up a CCTV system, you
don't need a licence. There is no government oversight agency. The technology
is outside data protection law - it's free from any constraint.&quot;</em><p>
The argument that &quot;if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to
fear...&quot; is a direct translation from the slogan of the Stasi, the old
East German secret police! In many instances, CCTV system operators routinely
exercise their prejudices to discriminate against race, age, class or sexual
preference. One camera operator in Burnley told a Granada documentary,
<em>&quot;People mainly with shirts and ties are OK. Most people you can tell
just by looking at them. Another said: I tell by the hair.&quot;</em><p>
The vast majority of cameras at present are visible and it is fairly easy to
know when we are being spied on, but as technology develops cameras are more
likely to be used for covert surveilance purposes. <em>&quot;All the systems
are now being marketed for their interconnectability. Once you create a system
that has a mass of potential links to other systems, not only does this
increase the power of the system, but also its uses. This is very powerful
military technology, becoming infinitely more powerful as each year passes.
Systems are going to be linked to computers. These are the foundation stones of
a surveillance society which will lock us in for all time.</em>&quot;<p>
Simon Davies will be speaking at the SchNEWS Direct Action Conference III in
the old Evening Argus building in North Rd, Brighton, Sat 10th at the  at 2pm.
The event runs Sat &amp; Sun, from 12.00 to 5.30. Free. For more details of the
conference ring 01273 685913.

<A NAME="shoreham">Shoreham Fit Up</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;Conspiracy laws are massively more effective than
the Criminal Justice Act, not least because they can do anyone including those
who write about or are associated with a breach of the law.&quot;</em><p>
Five animal rights activists involved in the Shoreham live export protests,
were given sentences this week ranging from two to six years. All were charged
with 'conspiracy to cause criminal damage' in a trial which lasted six months,
cost &#163;2m, and involved homes being raided with ridiculous search warrants,
police informers, and solicitors having their phones tapped and offices
burgled.<p>
 In effect the charges mean the defendants hadn't actually <strong>done
</strong>anything - just talked about it.  <em>And in the Shoreham case even
the judge in his summing up, invited the jury to acquit!</em> <p>
But who was so keen to nail those involved in the  Campaign Against Live
Freight (CALF)? This was no usual police investigation. A special unit led by a
Superindent Bentham set up Operation Kirby - not long after MI5 said they were
turning their attention to protestors - and seemed very keen on nailing
activists for any charges they could dream up.<p>
One Shoreham veteran told SchNEWS, <em>&quot;CALF helped organise a very
successful campaign of direct action, and the powers that be invented trumped
up charges to try to destroy the campaign.&quot;</em>

<A NAME="brazil">Brazilians Go Nuts for Squatting!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong>Around 12 million people in Brazil are landless...In 1995 over 150,000
people were illegally occupying unproductive farmland on 147 organised
camps...In 1996 thousands of activists blockaded streets in Sao Paulo, the
worlds 3rd largest city - within 2 hours the underground shut down in
support!</strong><p>
If you had 150,000 people doing direct action 7 days a week, week in week out
youd expect to a) be ruffling political feathers and getting towards what you
wanted, b) have huge public support and increasing numbers taking up direct
action, and c) face serious pressure from the powers that be. In Brazil this is
reality. Brazilian politicians are seen scuttling for cover, or posing for
photos (depending on political persuasion) as thousands upon thousands of
landless peasants from &quot;Movimento dos Trabalhadoes Rurais Sem Terra&quot;
(Movement for rural workers without land), or MST for short, converge on
Brazilia to demand land reform NOW. It is South America's largest - and most
important social movement - and they demand unused farmland be taken from large
landowners and given as small parcels to the millions of landless poor to grow
food and live on. Land reform is firmly on the political agenda. As for public
support, 83% of Brazilians now agree there should be large-scale land reform,
and direct action, usually by long term, largescale occupations of unproductive
farmland owned by business interests, is <em>the</em> tactic for the landless
to realise their  aims. <p>
<em>&quot;Widespread illiteracy has curbed write-a-letter-to-your-MP style
arguments.&quot;</em><p>
<em></em>But as with every powerful movement, when the authorities go in it is
nothing short of  murderous. A fortnight ago was the first anniversary of a
'Reclaim the Streets' style blockade of a highway in the Amazonian state of
Para (part of the month-long NVDA-fest - &quot;Scream for Land&quot;) that
ended in bloodshed. At the end of the day  - familiar to UK activists - a
police charge started, with 155 military cops charging from two directions
firing on the crowd: in the resulting chaos supposed &quot;leaders&quot; (MST
is reasonably non-heirarchical) were picked off and executed via a bullet in
the back of the head. Nineteen activists were murdered. All 155 military police
are still on active duty. No-one has been prosecuted. Hence the thousands
marching on Brazilia in protest two weeks ago.

<A NAME="bae">Briti-Share-a-Space</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Wednesday saw mass disruption of the British Aerospace AGM in
London, where directors hid behind glass screens, pot plants and security
guards - who forcibly removed 122 protesters (who had each purchased a nominal
share in BAe to gain entry) amid chants highlighting the companies supply of
Hawk attack aircraft to the Indonesian regime . Outside 200 other protesters
staged a symbolic 'die-in', and more 'disarmed' a model Hawk jet, the whole lot
resulting in what the Campaign Against Arms Trade reported  as a &quot;100%
domination of the meeting.&quot;<p>
Yet another successful AGM disruption has not gone down too well amongst
Britain's business leaders. The Institute Of Directors have called for the
predictable 'tough new laws' to  stop such embarrassing dissent at the one and
only time of the year that big business are publicly accountable for their
actions. They want to prevent shareholders who have a &quot;minimum number of
shares&quot; or have only held them for a certain length of time from
attending. <p>
And the plot thickens: Corporate Watch have highlighted a proposed change to
company law to remove the requirement for company directors to register their
home addresses at Companies House. To keep such channels open Corporate Watch
is compiling an address book of directors of unpopular companies, available to
all who need it. Send any addresses you have to CW, Box E, 111 Magdalen Rd,
Oxford OX41RQ, Tel/Fax 01865 791391 by May 10th

<li>	RTZ, the world's biggest mining corporation responsible for genocide and
displacement of indigenous people worldwide, including the Pacific Island of
Bougainville (where foreign mercenaries hired to crush rebels who had shut a
copper mine on the island were recently expelled by the army), are holding
their AGM on Wednesday 7th May at the QE2 centre in London.  Meet outside the
centre opposite Westminster Abbey (nearest tube St. James' Park) at 10:00 am.

<strong></strong>Newsflash! The residents of Holtsfield on the Gower Peninsula
in South Wales have won their case in the House of Lords to stop a landlord
destroying their homes. The article of law at stake was that the owner had
semi-feudal rights to do what s/he pleased with the land underneath the
dwellings. Thankfully this anomaly is no more, and dodgy landlords can shove
their eviction notices where even Pubemaster 2000 cannot  see them. Holtsfield:

<A NAME="knives">Caught in the Knife Act</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Oxford Police used section 60 of the  Knives Act this week on
a demo against vivisection. The Act gives increased powers for the police to
stop and search anyone in a particular area if they fear that violence might
occur. Nice little catch all law that means they have even more right to stop
and intimidate people for any reason they feel like.

<strong></strong>What ever next? Last week your mutated SchNEWS heard of yet
another genetic-engineering breakthrough: a potato which commits suicide if
infected with 'late blight'. This little pest is evidently a major source of
existential misery in the world of tubers claiming 20% of the annual UK crop.
If this is the way forward, then we can look forward to carrots that scream
abuse at marauding rabbits and lettuces that give slugs a good kicking. Happy
eating.
