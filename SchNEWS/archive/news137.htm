<h2><em>NEW </em> DIRECT ACTION</h2>
As Labour Party delegates enjoyed the sun in Fortress Brighton, the country witnessed its 
busiest week of actions since Labour came to power...
<h3>Friday</h3>
Barry Horne, on remand for alleged animal rights activities calls off his six week hunger 
strike. Barry refused food after the Labour Party began to back-track on pre-election pledges 
about vivisection. Now the Government has agreed to talks with three of Barry�s 
representatives, starting in two weeks.
<h3>Saturday</h3>
2nd anniversary of the Liverpool dock dispute. 5,000 people march in support.
<h3>Sunday</h3>
Thousands of people march around Brighton slogan-slogan-slogan stylee.
<p>The Gaelic Earth Liberation Front destroy the first genetically-engineered crop grown in 
Ireland.
<p>About 200 activists gather at Hillgrove Farm, Oxfordshire, in the latest demo against this 
notorious cat-breeding colony for vivisection. The presence of vast numbers of tooled-up 
Thames Valley cops prevents any serious action, but the pressure is kept up on nasty Farmer 
Brown. Home visits to Hillgrove workers follow; at the second, locals run a car into protesters- 
the police response is to knock a Swansea hunt sab over the bonnet and under the wheels, 
refuse to give an exact location for an ambulance, then pretend to arrest the driver but drive 
him away from possible vengeance and let him go.
<h3>Monday</h3>
Bristol Earth First! organise three days of action against the expansion of Durnford Quarry in Bristol, which 
has been given the go-ahead to expand into Ashton Court Park. After a hundred-strong mass trespass and mudbath on Sunday, 5 
people D-lock onto a security landrover blocking the entrance gate and closing the quarry for 4 hours.
<p>The Liverpool dockers &amp; Reclaim The Streets mystery tour splits in two. Dozens of 
people pile into a Dept of Trade &amp; Industry building shutting it for over 4 hours. Snowstorms 
of paper flutter earthwards as police shut off Victoria Street and evacuate two nearby 
buildings. 40 riot vans of cops eventually arrest 50 people, but most are released without 
charge. Down in Kent, 70 Liverpool dockers and a handful of activists picket Medway Docks, 
owned by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, those nice people who sacked all the 
Liverpool dockers in the first place. No cargoes unload.
<p>In Brighton claimants groups and the Welfare State Network are seriously outnumbered 
by cops expecting a Reclaim The Streets. People march with the cops to the Labour 
Conference, shout a bit, get bored, and go shut down a local jobcentre for an hour.
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
The first permanent animal rights protest camp is evicted, but another is quickly set up on 
land which may be bought if funds can be raised. The camps are outside the Huntingdon 
Research Centre, run by Huntingdon Life Sciences, a multi-national animal testing company. 
They�ve been under intense pressure following two undercover investigations earlier this year, 
which outraged the public and knocked &#163;80 million off their share prices overnight. The 
government has given them until Nov 30th to show improvements or have its licence to vivisect 
withdrawn. As SchNEWS went to press one person was still down a tunnel, and two more are 
in Holloway prison.
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
On the second anniversary of the sacking of 53 Hillingdon Hospital workers, 500 people attend a march and 
rally in the town. Later activists invade the Labour Party command centre in Walworth Road, London.
<P>Police tell Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), that they no longer want to police the COPEX 
arms trade expo following the days peaceful gate blockade. Victims of the torture trade, led by a Tibetan Monk, 
lead a silent procession of 300 to the main gate of exhibition at RAF Farnborough. Police refrain from a repeat of 
the mass arrest of 89 people at the same site one month ago, and allow three gates to be blocked with only two 
arrests. The Labour Conference, which this week refused to revoke arms licences to Indonesia, has nothing to do with it, of course.
<P>In purple robes, Palden Gyatso, imprisoned and tortured in China for 33 years, shows 
the electro-shock batons which had been smuggled out, and which British Aerospace were 
exposed for selling to Saudi Arabia at COPEX in 1994. Delegates from Turkey, Algeria, Colombia, 
Iran and Sri Lanka along with Indonesia and China are regular visitors to buy such goods as UK-made mortar 
launchers, grenades and civilian surveillance systems. COPEX say peaceniks are racists and funded by the 
Russians!
<UL>
<LI>Britain is the worlds fourth biggest arms exporter and CAAT are to target 1,500 arms companies 
on its database. Go to the first Factory Action Network Day on Oct 12th.

<h2>Golden Shower</h2>
Any readers with scabies or other parasitic infestations should go and stand on top of a hill on Monday. NASA�s 
Cassini probe is due to explode on launching and shower us all with plutonium, which is noted for its effectiveness 
in eradicating crabs, and indeed all other lifeforms. The plutonium we are told, is only there to provide electricity 
for some of the scientific instruments on board - which could work as easily utilising solar energy. It is thought that 
the material is so toxic that just 1lb of it would induce lung cancer in every person on earth. 
<P>Since the 60�s, the US has launched 24 space craft carrying nuclear material. Of these, three have crashed. Alan Kohn, a former emergency 
operations officer, called the housing of the plutonium <em>"indestructible, just like the Titanic was unsinkable..."</em>

<h2>Irish Action</h2>
Camden Irish Centre has banned Anti Fascist Action (AFA) from holding an international conference of anti-
fascist groups, on the grounds that "political" events might jeopardise the Centres charitable status. This is a bit of 
a mystery since the centre regularly hosts meetings associated with the Irish republican movement. AFA has a 
long history of defending such meetings against fascist attacks, and the booking for the conference was made 
openly under AFA�s name nearly six months ago. AFA are calling for people to contact Camden Irish Centre by 
letter or phone to let them know what you think of their decision.

<h2>Doing anything on Wednesday?</h2>
Peabody Coal is strip-mining Navajo and Hopi sacred land in Northern Arizona. It�s 
transported to the generating station via a "slurry line" (a pipe carrying a coal and water 
mixture), for which Peabody extracts 1.2 <strong>billion</strong> gallons of water a year. 
This is drying up springs which have been relied upon by local people for generations. An 
International Day of Action has been called for this Wednesday (Oct 8th). Possible 
spontaneous assembly points at 10.30am: The Energy Group plc, 117 Piccadilly, London W1. 
Hanson plc, 1 Grosvenor Place, London SW1. Eastern Group plc, Wherstead Park, 
Wherstead, Ipswich, Suffolk. Contact: Big Mountain Support Network, PO Box 3412,

<h2>SchNEWS in Brief</h2>
<UL>
<LI>Some people who set up camp in Devon to stop a developer trashing two rivers (so we can all 
have clay toilets) are on a <strong>protest walk</strong> to Houses of Parliament. A mere stroll at 
235 miles, they hope to do it in just 12 days. They are gonna hand in a letter from the local people to 
John Prescott demanding a public enquiry. If you�d like to join in ring 0467 622825. If that�s a bit 
much why not join them on the last leg: Thursday 9th Hyde Park Speakers Corner 1.30 pm 
<LI>SchNEWS was chuffed to receive the premier copy of the <strong>Cruxifier</strong>, an 
anarchist newssheet written from within a psychiatric hospital. This is an ambitious project, and they

recommended� copy of issue 73 or want to keep in touch send SAE and some stamps to BM Box

<h2>and finally</h2>
<em>"You ain�t got a security tag, then you�re not coming in"</em>
<P>Greetings from sunny Brighton where the Labour Party are leaving nothing to chance. A 6 foot perimeter 
fence, police surveillance <em>airship</em>, extra CCTV cameras, cops on every corner, crash barriers 
concreted into the road... now what was that about "open government"?
<UL>
<LI>So, just what are they scared of? Surely not the left-organised demo on Sunday when cops kept a 
very low profile. Around 8,000 marched through Brighton before the Conference had really begun, 
ending up at a rally nicely out of sight. One paper spoke of Labour "fraying at the edges." Yeah, with 
93% of the public thinking Blair is cool - according to a recent poll - we�re sure the leadership is 
shaking in its boots. SchNEWS wonders just what those eight thousand people could have done had 
they instead joined in with the solidarity actions in support of the Liverpool dockers on the Monday... 
<LI>SchNEWS tried to stop laughing on Monday at everybody�s favourite Brighton bobby Sergeant 
Gary Keating of the town�s Public Order Unit (the people who go round harassing activists.) It seems 
that Keating had thought Reclaim The Streets (RTS) were planning to visit Brighton for the day. So 
he gathered his troops (plus a few from the Met) in their nice black boiler suits, so suitable for this 
weather, and surrounded a rather small demo against benefit cuts. Demonstrators were handed sheets 
threatening anyone on the RTS/Job Seekers Allowance protest that if they so much as sneezed or did 
anything effective they would be nicked. SchNEWS wonders how much explaining our luckless bobby 
had to do to his superiors after telling them there was going to be a street party in Brighton! Better 
luck next time Big Gary, and if you want your SchNEWS on time without having to piss about 
furtively in all those disreputable places that give it out in Brighton, why don�t you subscribe and 
we�ll stick you on our "free to prisoners" list!
<LI>On Monday, bored of chanting "Labour, Labour, give us some crumbs," claimants demonstrated 
outside a Job Centre instead. After about half an hour a couple of people arrived looking very bleary-
eyed for so early in the day. It transpired that those kind people at the Shooter�s Rights fringe meeting 
had been giving away wine to draw people in. Word got out and everyone had a few, which helped to 
loosen vocal chords as they shouted the meeting down, before getting ejected.
<LI>How did they know about the meeting? Well it seems a leaflet had been circulated telling 
everyone which fringe meetings had free drink and food. "The Blaggers Guide to the Best of the 
Labour Party Conference" encourages you to <em>"exercise your right to free speech by going along 
to them, and make sure that you take advantage of the free food and drink available from the Labour 
Party!"</em>
<LI>On Monday evening we were treated to a reminder of what it was like when Labour was last in 
power, and had a spot of bother with the unions. There was a huge power cut on the sea-front, and 
most of the hotels hosting Labour delegates were blacked out! Seeboard says it was very sorry, but this 
didn�t stop cries of "New Labour- no Leccy" from revellers outside Brighton Centre that evening, as 
worried delegates scuttled around in the dark, fearing terrorist attacks! 
<LI>Delegates have been keeping themselves cool with fans bearing the Manchester Airport logo. We 
could have told them about the airline industry and global warming, but they wouldn�t let us in.
<LI>And finally finally back to those new police toys which really came in handy when a bomb 
cunningly disguised as a bicycle was destroyed for the audacity of getting too near the exclusion zone.
