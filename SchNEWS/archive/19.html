<center><H3><a name=landisours><HR width=0% size=0>Reclaim the land! </a></H3></center>That's right folks! This Sunday, St George's Day, the conscious masses of Britain will converge on a soon-to-be-very-well-known site in south-east England in a week-long occupation to take back what is rightfully ours.<br> The roads programme, the persecution of travellers, gypsies and protestors, the destruction of our countryside by intensive farming, the abominable treatment of farm animals and the loss of public spaces in towns are not the causes of injustices but it's symptoms. All reflect one underlying problem: the exclusive ownership of land.<br> Trespass is a concept almost unique to these shores. Whose land is it anyway? Today between 50% and 75% of Britain is owned by one percent of its people. The land is our common inheritance. From time immemorial until the 18th century every one of us had the right to wander its surface. Now we have the means to reclaim our birthright. It's our turn to set the agenda.<center><b>GO FOR IT!</b></center> Bring tools, ideas, camping gear, water containers, seeds, spades, musical instruments, drums, banners, paint, anything creative ... and we'll leave the land better than we found it! NB Keep off the grass! <p>

<center><b>Meet at CoolTan, 372 Coldharbour Lane, Brixton, London at 10am for coaches or go to Fleet Service Station (M3 E/bound, between J4 & J5 at 12 noon)<br> OR PHONE 0171 501 9253 AFTER 3pm SUNDAY FOR VENUE.<br> Limited parking - use public transport if possible.<br> See yer there!</b></center><p><HR width=80% size=3>
<center><H4><a name=naughtybutnice><HR width=0% size=0>ESSEX POLICE THREATEN </a>RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST - NOT SHOCK!</H4></center>
Protests against live animal exports continued at Brightlingsea despite threats by Essex police to nick people under the 1986 Public Order Act - for simply demonstrating! More than 600 people were out on the streets despite a letter sent to every household by the assistant chief constable implicitly warning that they risked arrest and imprisonment for simply being there!<br>
On Tuesday 3 former members of Brightlingsea Against Live Export were arrested for obstruction of the highway. Under the Criminal JusticeAct police are empowered to impose bail conditions without going to court first.  Their bail conditions state that  they are not allowed to take part in any active demonstrations against live exports in Brightlingsea.  When the police were asked to clarify this they stated that even standing in a window or in your front garden with a banner would be actively demonstrating.  One of those arrested lives near the port in Brightlingsea - even taking his child to school, past the demonstrations, could mean he ends up in prison for breaking his bail conditions<br> 
Section 11 of the Public Order Act requires organisers of a procession to notify police six days in advance.  Failure to do so, could result in a �1,000 fine.  If police are notified, they can impose conditions.  If these are breached, organisers could face a three month prison sentence.  Those taking part in a demonstration where no notification is given are also committing a criminal offence.<br> 
Conditions of the Public Order Act can  only be imposed to deal with serious disruption to the life of the community - but when 1500 people (that's nearly 20% of the town) turned up to a public meeting last Sunday. To voice their  anger  at the threat to the loss of the right to protest - we've got to ask whose community is it that is being disrupted?<br>  <center><i>Clearly Brightlingsea doesn't want live exports.</i></center><p><HR width=80% size=3>

<a name=upyoursnational><HR width=0% size=0>The National Trust last</a> week moved swiftly to evict travellers from land they recently bought from Brighton Borough Council.  Glynn Jones,  said he wanted a "reputation or being firm, fair and very fast"  with any travellers who set up site on NT land.  Using Bylaw 21, which is even more draconian than the CJA, police and bailiffs arrived at 7 in the morning ("so as to not disrupt traffic") with 3 tow-trucks to move the site, dumping two vehicles to the side of the road - no longer a NT problem!

CS Gas, a highly toxic battlefield immobilisation gas, banned by international agreement as a chemical warfare agent in January, has been given the go-ahead by Michael Howard for police trials and will be used as "a last resort" say the Home Office.<br>
Beth Stephen�s, a lawyer with the Centre for Constitutional Rights (a public interest law firm based in New York) says tests have documented at least 80 deaths caused by exposure to CS Gas. Sixteen police forces in England and Wales will carry out trials in the coming months. "Ultimately every bobby on the beat may carry them" said the influential quango Association of Chief Police Officers.<br>
Trials initially will include routine carrying of hand-held CS aerosol canisters for 'self-defence'. On the continent the gas is the standard riot dispersal weapon. CS Gas (O-chlorobenzylidene malonitrite) was banned this year at the Chemical Weapons Convention signed in Paris by 131 nations yet fast-forward a year and Essex police could be using it against residents demonstrating at Brightlingsea or at any other major public order flashpoint.<br>
The American government has agreed not to use CS Gas against Iraqi (or any other) enemy soldiers. Amnesty International calls CS "particularly dangerous when used in massive quantities in heavily built up or populous areas".<br> 

The Home Office claims "it has been thoroughly tested and scientist have found that it doesn't present a serious risk to health" yet Alistair Hay, a world authority on the effects of chemical weapons, states, somewhat plainly: "There is not as much research on CS Gas as there ought to be".<br>
CS Gas will join the growing armoury of British police. Heckler and Koch MP5 sub-machine carbines, Smith & Wesson .38 revolvers, ballistic and stab resistant vast and extendible side-handled baton. <p><HR width=80% size=3><p>
<a name=partypooped><HR width=0% size=0><center>Loughborough police could</a> be the first force in the country to use Section 63 (2) of the CJA which bans illegal assemblies, in order to prevent an unlicensed party happening .  Police, alerted that a large marquee had been erected, stopped the sound system from being installed and later turned away several hundred people who only wanted to (heinous crime 2) have a party.   Leicester Advance Party commented "After spending six months targeting hunt sabs, the police obviously now feel confident enough to attract 'ravers' with the new legislation....."

He yelled: "I fucking signed on this morning, give me my fucking money" before smashing up �5,000 worth of computer equipment demanding his Giro. The centre was evacuated and all exits sealed off as police marksmen and Territorial Support Group were put on high alert. He was charged with affray, criminal damage and attempted GBH on a police officer...

A Shoreham protester has been denied bail and kept in remand at Holloway until May 2nd for breaking bail conditions banning her from the Port area. Mother-of-one Barbara Trenholm, 43, the first protester to be imprisoned since live export demonstrations began, was originally charged with alleged public order offences. Speaking from jail she said: "I am very angry. Nobody is going to take my democratic rights away. I am going to carry on protesting, they won't stop me." Prior to her court cases one man charged with grievous body harm was released. The Public Order Act has been used against 250 protestors to take them out of action by imposing stringent bail conditions.<br>

Six police officers arrested a QPR fan at the Newcastle game for the "heinous crime" of selling a spare ticket at cost price. In Court officers had to explain CJA Section 166 aimed specifically at ticket touts to the judge who couldn't understand a crime had been committed as the ticket was not fraudulent, stolen or even sold for profit. He received a conditional discharge. Over at Wycombe Wanderers FC in a top piece of police detective work a plain clothes officer bought ONE spare ticket off two Birmingham City fans who were then promptly arrested and stuck in the cells for eight hours...<p><HR width=80% size=3><p><center> <H4>Strictly @nti-copyright .... customise! photocopy! distribute!</H4></center><p><HR width=80% size=3><p>
