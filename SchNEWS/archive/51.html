Jobcentre staff round the country are out on indefinite strike. Yesterday dole workers from as far afield as Inverness and Cornwall stopped hassling and found common cause with the unwaged! So what's it all about, and will people still get giros? SchNEWS spoke to someone in the dole-workers' union, the CPSA, who are masterminding the walkout, to put us in the picture....<br>
"The civil service used to be a job for life," said our dole-mole, "but government changes in recent years have resulted in job insecurity and low pay." 11,000 workers have been promised that they will be joining the dole queues if the government gets its way. Some people in the employment service are even  making claims for housing benefits and family credit due to financial hardship. This is the background to the strike,  but the main cause of the problem is this year's pay offer - 2.5% - and the dog eat dog nightmare of performance-related pay.<br> 
"This means that pay rises are not linked to inflation but to 'performance'. Workers have to reach targets for getting people back to work and are graded A-D. If they receive a D they are sacked. In other words, the more people they hassle off the unemployment figures, the more money they get - and if they don't hassle enough people they get sacked! <br>
"Most of us wouldn't mind getting people into work," said our man, "but most of our targets are geared towards stopping benefit, and the jobs we advertise are increasingly 'rubbish' - low-pay, no-hope jobs that offer little security and often don't have contracts." 
<br>And, of course, there is the prospect of the Job Seekers' Allowance (JSA) on the horizon too. The JSA is replacing income support and unemployment benefit in October next year. It will give the Employment Service discretionary powers to make the unemployed accept low-paid work or dead-end training schemes.  It could even mean kicking people off the dole because they don't like your appearance.<br>
This is expected to increase the already large numbers of violent incidents involving doleworkers and members of the public - nearly 8,000 between 1989 and 1994, including 1000 actual physical assaults, one involving a man weilding a samurai sword! <br>Despite this, workers have only been given two days' training in dealing with such problems. Our man reckoned that claimants have every right to be angry about the way the system works: "Benefits are absolutely crap, they are suspended if you lose your job or are sacked and you're living on �18 a week. What amazes me is how little trouble we get."<br>
Morale amongst workers has shot up considerably since the strike was called, despite the number of strike breakers and casual, non-unionised workers who are manning some offices. And if they lose, our man warned of "guerilla action" by workers constantly disputing the grading system.<br>
Finally, we were told "people who work in the offices and the unwaged really have something in common."<br>
Giros will still be issued without the need to sign - BUT GO ANYWAY!<br>
Take a trip to JobCentres, support the striking dole workers and stop the JSA! (In Brighton head for Upper North Street Job Centre every weekday)<p>
You can really piss off the people who are still working by: <br> 
*going in and asking if you have to sign on;<br>
*making pointless enquiries about useless training schemes;<br>
*demanding restarts (don't worry,  you probably won't get one);<br>
*asking them why they aren't striking when a quarter of the jobs in the  Employment Service are gonna be cut if the JSA is implemented;<br>
*asking why everything's taking so long...<p>
See yer there!<p>

A lack of site provision for Britain's travellers has once again led to problems being deliberately stirred up between travellers and people living near their sites. <br>Around 15 Romany Gypsies who were parked up on some land in the Sea Mills area of Bristol  found themselves at the centre of a row enflamed by a local private security firm. 
System & Security (SAS) are employed by local residents to patrol the Sea Mills area.  <br>In a leaflet circulated by the firm travellers stand accused of an "upsurge of crime... representing an extremely serious threat to public law and order which the police are ignoring".  With language guaranteed to whip up race-hate - and on the side, scare people into paying the private security firm money to 'protect' them from the travellers - the gypsies are described as  "a rabble of maurauding tinkers who see your homes and possessions as fair game and as some sort of giant Supermarket take-away for their criminal shopping activities." <br> The pamphlet urges the local council - which it describes as "a bunch of soppy, limp-wristed liberals" - to use the CJA against the travellers "apart from (the Council) making the lives of this itinerant trash as comfortable as possible by providing running water, toilets and a free rubbish removal service, these jumped-up mandarins are doing sweet fanny adams." The leaflet ends with a call for residents to implement a campaign of direct action! <br>
Bowing to pressure Bristol City Council gave forms to all local residents - asking for them to note disturbances by the gypsies with descriptions of any trouble-makers. 
SAS boss Andrew Burke however has been warned by the police not to take matters into his own hands and when SchNEWS rang the local constabularly we were told that they were currently "looking at private security firms and their activities."  Asked about the 'upsurge of crime' a Chief Inspector told us "their was a slight increase in crime, but it couldn't necessarily be put down to the travellers." <br>
TheSchNEWS asked The Gypsy Council whether Burke could be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred. A spokesperson told us that when they've complained about similar leaflets in the past the Directory of Public Prosecutions has taken no action. "We are very concerned - where are the travellers supposed to go? Local residents should be asking the local authorities to find proper sites." <br>
The Criminal Justice Act abolished the Caravan Sites Act which gave councils a legal duty to establish sites for travellers. (not that many did) Lack of sites and increased harrassment has, it is estimated, led to over half of Britain's travellers going abroad in the last few years. Traditional stopping places are being gated, blocked and ditched off (one survey in the Somerset area revealed that 72% of the traditional sites were now unusable).  <br>
Not all travellers are angels and some sites can cause problems but marginalising, whipping up fear and hate - isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany where gypsies were wiped out? <br>
FACT: It is estimated that there are 210,000 acres of derelict land in Britain alone! (figures from the Royal Society for Nature Conservation) - plenty of room for Britain's travellers to live in peace.<p>

The US government has quietly taken legal possession of the genetic code of a living tribesman in a third world country. <br>US PATENT NUMBER: 5,397,696 was awarded to the US Dept of Heath and Human Services for the DNA of a man from the remote Hagahai people in the North of Papua New Guinea, the first secured by a government over the genes of a foreign national. The government will be making millions of pounds from drugs derived from the genes of poor people without giving them a share in the patents. <br>Over in Munich they are drafting the terms of a patent concerning a mouse which has been genetically-engineered to develop cancer, which if passed would mean that man can claim some life as an 'invention' rather than a 'product of nature'. <br>Before the European vote, Greenpeace sent Members of the European Parliament this heavenly message:<br> "In the beginning the Lord created the heavens and the Earth and all therein<br> But Scientists said: 'Let the seas be populated by fish containing human, mouse and rat genes'<br>And HOECHST and MONSANTO said: 'Let the land produce plants and trees bearing fruit containing bacteria and virus genes<br>And CIBA GEIGY said: 'Let the corn grow containing scorpion genes<br> And ZENECA made all kinds of fruit and vegetables and they did not rot<br> By the seventh day the work of the Lord had been undone and the companies saw they had recreated life for their own ends<br>And the Parliament of Angels blessed the Seventh Day and made all life patentable"

<center><H3>SQUATTING IN BRIGHTON
</H3></center><p>

This week Brighton Council saw fit to evict eight people from Richmond Parade, a row of shops that have been empty for nearly three years. <br>The court summons came, an affadavit was sworn and despite the occupiers showing that Brighton Council could not even prove they owned the place, the council got their way. The occupiers were granted a "mercy" period of three weeks whilst they looked for somewhere else to go and whilst no one likes to be evicted it was felt that some small victory had been achieved. <br>
This was not to be. One week later a 24 hour eviction came. The bailiff banging on the shop front plastering the row of shops with eviction notices.The Courthouse squatted by Justice? last year is still empty despite assurances that the enormous building would be used to house the homeless. Empty too is another of Justice?'s community centres - Brighton Council's ex-Housing Advice Centre.<br> 
It's not suprising really. If you walk into the courts today there's a nice little leaflet produced by Brighton Council that explains how to evict squatters via the new Interim Possession Orders.  "SQUATTERS" it says "A QUICK AND EASY SOLUTION'.  Well, that shows exactly where Brighton Council stands on the subject of homelessness doesn't it! <br>
New figures published this week by the Empty Homes Agency shows there are over 700,000 properties lying empty in this country today and a staggering 1.9 million homeless (Shelter).  The "quick and easy solution" is obvious - squat the lot!<br>
* Graves Son and Jenkins the letting agents are to go down for the first IPO served in Brighton. SchNEWS rung them up and the nice man said that the matter was in the hands of their solicitors and they hoped that the "intruder" problem would be resolved by Monday.  <br>
They also asked if we wanted the listings of their empty properties. Cheers! We did.

Last week's Budget was seen by many as the government's last desperate attempt to bribe "middle England" into voting for them at the next election - and gave a glimpse into the nightmare world of what bribing this paranoid, privileged group means for the rest of us. <br>We got promised 5,000 extra police over the next three years, 10,000 extra close circuit TVs, housing benefit cuts for under 25s, 75% insulation grant cuts for pensioners and �5bn cuts in social security spending each year by the year 2000. They also plan to scrap inheritance tax. This will cost the government �1.6 billion (the equivalent of 3p off income tax). The families who own the 5,000 most wealthy estates will be an average �160,000 better off!  <br>We're used to these handouts for the rich, increased state powers and attacks on the poor but we thought the Conservatives were firm believers in the forget-it-all-for-an-instant philosophy of getting pissed to escape the horror of it all. Only for some it seems. They reduced the price of a bottle of whisky by 27p - while increasing the price of strong cider by 8p. <br>Now who could they be trying to get at...?

Dear SchNEWS,<br>
We see that you published Shell's free phone number last week but omitted to mention their freepost address. Wouldn't it be a shame if Shell had to pay for bricks, stones, rubbish and even shit being sent to them - <br>Shell Smart, Freepost 437, Warrington, Cheshire WA4 6ZZ.<br>
Also, a new craze of fly-by paint throwers are targetting Shell stations. Pots of red paint are being thrown at Shell garages to remind them that people will not forget that they have blood on their hands. Seemingly these people don't hang around to get caught but keep running to the next one. Shell stations are all over the place, but so are paint throwers; garages have cameras so they wear different clothes than usual, a mask and are very quick.<br>
We felt we had to report these two disgusting matters so you could warn SchNEWS readers not to get involved in this new craze. it may be addictive..."

Sneaky wildcat dockers on strike in Liverpool over causual labour closed down port gates using a new form of Critical Mass - without bikes! They marched round and round a major roundabout during rush hour causing complete gridlock and no lorries or cars could enter the port.<br>
500 dockers have been on strike for nine weeks - Unions in Canada and the United States have given their full support. Drake International, the firm behind the scab labour have found it's not all plain-sailing destroying jobs and communities - their offices occupied by dockers in direct action. <br>
Despite this growing support - and with Britain being Britain - the strikers still don't have the support of their own union! As for the Labour Party, SchNEWS enquiries revealed that the people's party considered view on the nine week lock-out is... "We don't normally comment on industrial disputes".  So what do they comment on?!<br> Support the dockers<br><b> 0151 207 3388</b><p>

After nearly four years of police investigations and court hearings, Animal Liberation Front (ALF) press officer <b>Robin Webb</b> is to stand trial at Winchester Crown Court.   <br>He has been charged with breaching the obscure and rarely used Section 38 of the 1986 Public Order Act. He passing on information to the press about a claim that battery eggs in a supermarket had been contaminated.  The offence carries a sentence of 10 years and the judge has imposed a press blackout. <br>
Robin became ALF press officer in October 1991 and his job was to explain to the media why some people break the law to help animals.  Since then, he has been arrested 7 times, and has spent a total of almost 7 months in prison on remand.  His bail conditions have included not leaving his home town, attending a police station every day, not making any public statements and not attending any animal related events.
His house has been searched by Kent, Staffordshire, Hampshire, Lothian and Borders and the Met Police forces and the Anti Terrorist Squad.  2 ansaphones, 6 typewriters, a fax machine, all address books, diaries and stationery, accounts and bank books and all the press office merchandise have been confiscated.<br>
A flyer sent to the SchNEWS said "All this adds up to a blatant attempt by the authorities to suppress free speech where animal rights is concerned.  Robin is being stitched up with the police will try to portray him as an isolated and dangerous extremist.  The press will not be allowed to even mention the case.  Anyone publicising the result of the trial will be liable to prosecution and imprisonment.  Don't let them get away with it.  Show your solidarity by turning up on the opening day of the trial, Monday 4th December."<br>

For fire-breathing!  <br>A women was arrested while fire-breathing outside the gates of Faslane Nuclear Submarine Base in Scotland last August.  She was charged with six counts of assault and breach of the peace.  Pleading guilty to breach of the peace she was fined �500 and told by Sheriff Fitzsimmonds "You're really lucky your not going to prison"! Our intrepid fire-breather is appealing to the High Court. <p>
For holding up a banner which read 'Abacha; Shell stop the Murders'.  <br>Nine people nicked for this one, outside the Nigerian High Commission under the Public Order Act with words that could 'cause alarm, harrassment or distress'. We at the SchNEWS stupidly thought that the police's job was to stop murders - not arrest people for protesting against them. Silly old us!  Clearly the superior logic of the Met is beyond the understanding of us mere mortals who are-not-worthy to wear the Uniform Of Blue.
