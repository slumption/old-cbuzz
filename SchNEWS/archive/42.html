<p>
It could have been an historic case  further undermining our right to protest. But a judge ruled that all but one of thirteen people taken to court by an animal exporter were within the law by taking direct action at the port. They  appeared in the High Court last Friday in an attempt by Roger Mills and his company  Live Sheep Traders to ban them from demonstrating against  animal exports at Brightlingsea in Essex.<p>
Arguing that the sheer number of arrests - 583 to date - and the existence of Brightlingsea Against Live Exports (BALE) -whose leaflets were 'an attempt to whip up emotion and incite others to break the law' - was clearly a conspiracy to injure his business .He wanted  costs and damages of more than �500,000 and a High Court injunction.<p>
However, the Judge Mr.Justice Forbes said that there were occasions when unlawful activities gained the admiration for law-abiding citizens "<b>What Mahatma Gandhi did was certainly against the law......but most people approved of what he did.</b>"<p>
One of the defendants Andrew Abbot  argued that he had a moral right and duty to hinder the live export trade and  that his protests had been aimed at the government "<b>who not only allow but effectively encourage this abhorrence</b>"   He was given an injunction not to interfere with the trade thru' Brightlingsea for his troubles.  However, the judge refused to grant injunctions against the other twelve.<p>
If Mills had won with the use of civil law  it would have meant protesters would have had a lot more to worry about than the Criminal Justice Act (CJA). There are very few ways in this country that people can change policies they consider to be wrong. That is why there has been such an upsurge in direct action in recent years.<p> <center><b>THE GOVERNMENT MUST LEARN THAT IT CANNOT STIFLE<br> PEOPLES' VOICES THROUGH DRACONIAN LEGISLATION.</b></center><p>
* In a similar case this year the Department of Transport (DoT) and Tarmac took out  an injunction for costs  of �3.5 million against 47 named people involved in the Twyford Down road protests.  This was later changed to each defendant having to pay �500  to the DoT.  Needless to say most haven't yet coughed up a penny.<p>
 * More than 1,200 people have been arrested during the protests against live animal exports at ports and airports across the country in operations costing more than �7 million, according to police figures.<p>
*  The RSPCA called for a new inquiry into the transport of live animals after it was revealed that a consignment of British sheep from Dover, travelled for more than 57 hours from Holland to Greece without water or rest.

Around four thousand people from the  Ramblers Association staged rallies and walks at over 100 locations last Sunday declaring it Open Britain Day - as well as the  launch of their Access Bill<p> 
Labours' Environment Secretary Frank Dobson  pledged party support for ramblers' right to roam.  In his speech he promised to "remove the threat of the new law of aggravated trespass  being used against innocent people enjoying the countryside.  When it  comes to harming the countryside, when it comes to what I think of as aggravated trespass, it's not walkers who are the main culprits.   It's not walkers who have covered whole swathes of our countryside with concrete and called it a transport policy.  It's not walkers who have rooted out 100,000 miles of hedgerows in the last decade.  It's not walkers who have polluted rivers with pesticides and chemical fertilisers.''<p> Fine words, but when <b>SchNEWS</b> pressed Dobson on whether or not he voted for or against the Criminal Justice Act or whether aggravated trespass should be used against protestors such as Hunt Sabs and Road protestors he  refused to  answer - and put the phone down on us!  That's New Labour for yer - even the police aren't as rude as that to <b>SchNEWS</b>!

Lindis Percy a health worker active in the peace movement since the days of Greenham Common (where Britain's American cruise missiles used to be kept) has been charged with 'aggravated trespass' - seven times! Arrested at Alconbury (where the National Security Agency are based) under sections 68 & 69, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) decided just before the trial to add 5 more charges - at Feltwell, Chicksands, Creighton, Mildenhall and Molesworth army bases.<p>Section 69 is a worrying catch-all; a police officer only has to suspect that you are going to commit 'aggravated trespass" (ie disrupting lawful activity) to make an arrest!  On International Women's Day for Disarmament in May she was arrested and held overnight because she refused police bail conditions. The next day Thetford magistrates told her not to go near Feltwell military base and report daily between 3-5pm at Bradford police station!

The first two people nicked under the Draconian 'trespassory assembly' sections  of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) are up in court this Tuesday (Oct 3rd)  Margaret Jones and Richard Lloyd were arrested outside Stonehenge in June - whilst commemorating ten years since the Battle of the Beanfield.*<p> The new law bans gatherings of more than 20 people on private land - but was recently defeated in court when self-proclaimed King Arthur Uther Pendragon, official sword bearer of the Secular Order of Druids -was acquitted.  Police evidence that their we're 27 people there included a German TV crew, some legal observers, a couple of drunk Italians (and a partridge in a Pear tree!).  Because of this ruling the defendants feel  that their is a  strong vested interest in convicting them. They need your support!  <b>9.30 am Salisbury Magistrates Court, Market Square.</b><p>

<p>
A new group has been set up to try and encourage young people to register to vote. M-Power is part of Activ88, the youth wing of Charter 88. "We do believe that a mass registration of young people, all making coherent demands for what they believe in, would be a powerful force to back up the campaigns that are happening around the country," says spokesman Colin Harvard.<p>
With so many young people excluded from the voting process due to DSS hassle, apathy, homelessness and a variety of other problems, M-Power sees itself as encouraging a wider debate on the subject-including those who feel that voting is simply a waste of time. Even if a lot of young people decided not to vote in the next election, then this would prompt the question why? M-Power hope to address these issues now.

 Two homeless people in Bristol could be the first in the country to  face prosecution under the new squatting sections of the  Criminal Justice Act (CJA).  Bristol Council refused to use the CJA to evict so the Bristol Church Housing Association who own the building  which had been empty for two months has taken the squatters to court. The new laws mean that if you fail to get out after being served an Intertim Possession Order (IPO)  you could face a 6 month jail sentence or a �5,000 fine - all for the crime of being homeless!  <b>SchNEWS</b> rang the Church  to get their opinion but we're told they'd have to check our creditionals before answering any questions! <br>Give 'em a ring 0117 9445710 ....and  get to the court case on Monday 10 am Corn St., Bristol <p>

<b>Mike Roberts</b>, 55 year old and founder member of CALF (Campaign Against Live Freight) was arrested 10 days ago on charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage.  Police have denied bail because they said he was going to abscond - they based this on the fact that  cuddly toys were missing from his mantelpiece!  This is the second time the police have arrested and raided Mike's house in just over a month.<br> 
An animal rights activist told <b>SchNEWS</b> that  Mike was well known to the police as his trusty camcorder had been used in video evidence to get  people off trumped up charges at the Shoreham demonstrations. In fact earlier this week a hearing was postponed because police refused to release some of his confiscated video evidence to the defendant. News just in.......Mike has been questioned from 7 am to 10 pm every day last week and had to be treated for high blood pressure at the end of it.

It started with William Waldegrave. He went to Bristol for  a walkabout a few days after the death of Jill Phillips, only to get chased by twenty people. They tried to punch him in the head and succeeded in giving him a knee in the bollocks. Then last week his mate Brian Mawhinney got a taste of it too. 10 people demonstrated against nuclear testing outside the club where he was speaking but were driven away by security.<p> Then some bright spark realised there was a fire escape leading up to the room where the meeting was. So up they all went and burst in through the door. One woman pushed over a load of displays and tipped up Bri's desk." That was one for the Newbury bypass," she said.  Then it went right off, with a hundred Tories joining in the ruck. The police showed but didn't even bother arresting anyone. "It was a pretty cool day, " said one of the protesters. We don't suppose any more Tories will be heading off there again in a hurry.
