<A NAME="hotline">01273 292229</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>This is Brighton &amp; Hove Council's emergency
shop-a-traveller hotline.  We are supposed to ring it if we spot any nomadic
undesirables on our patch, so that the Council can send in the Special
Harassment and Intimidation Taskforce.  Under no circumstances should SchNEWS
readers ring this number and give the Council false or misleading information,
as this would make the hotline completely unworkable.<p>
&quot;You're talking about real people, our lives are just like yours, we just
happen to live on wheels.&quot;<br><strong>- Linda, Patcham
traveller</strong><p>
<strong></strong>Two hundred travellers are to be &quot;driven out of
town&quot; in a knee-jerk `get tough' move by Brighton &amp; Hove Council
designed to send a New Labour zero tolerance message across the country. <p>
Until last May Bank holiday, Sussex had been the only county in the UK with a
`toleration' policy for travellers, providing water, sanitation and rubbish
removal. But now an eviction order is to be heard in court this Monday,
rubber-stamping the U-turn in a move denounced as &quot;racist .. with echoes
of ethnic cleansing&quot; by Green Cllr Pete West. If any other minority group
were treated in this way it would be condemned as fascistic, which in fact it
is. The eviction is expected a week later (19th June).<p>
Leader of the Council (and ex-squatter) Steve Bassam decided enough was enough
after a two-day party in Horsdean site, near Patcham. Bassam announced the end
the practice of tolerated sites and would lobby the new Labour government to
change the law and find a permanent solution to the `problems' of travellers.
&quot;Frankly<em>..</em>.&quot; he said,&quot;...Brighton needs a break.&quot;
<em>Frankly, after hundreds of years of persecution, travelling people need a
break.</em><p>
<em></em>In September 1995, a High Court judge upheld a case involving
travellers at Crowborough, East Sussex and  called the CJA `Draconian' and
&quot;unlawful&quot;. He said housing and child care had to be taken into
account before evictions could proceed. Thirty children live at Braepool, yet
the Council have simply issued a statement saying travellers &quot;with a
proven local connection and who are genuinely homeless will be offered welfare,
housing and educational advice.&quot; What an option! Lose yer home and get
some advice... but only if you have some `local connection'. Needless to say,
many people don't intend to take this lying down.<p>
<em>&quot;We have a great deal to lose - jobs, children's schooling, access to
courses in the town and medical care are all jeopardised. We have every reason
to maintain positive links with the area.&quot;<br></em><strong>- Traveller's
statement</strong><em></em><p>
<em></em>Despite publicly supporting the Department of the Environment guidance
stating travellers should not be &quot;forcibly evicted if any nuisance can be
controlled by other means&quot;, in private the Council are clearly determined
to evict and make Sussex a traveller-free zone. They have even set up an
emergency line if anyone spots one. In a circular to all councillors, Chris
Whitwell - Assistant Director of Environmental Services - told members to keep
their eyes peeled. <em>&quot;It may be that you will be notified by your
constituents that travellers have moved into your Ward, in which case the
appropriate action would be to ring the Council's emergency number.&quot;
</em>The police will do the rest.<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Brighton's policy of tolerance for the past two years has
meant that if travellers found an out-of-the-way site and caused minimal
nuisance, they would be left alone. However, thanks to the Criminal Justice
Act's anti-traveller measures, Brighton has become a magnet for the travelling
community - with anything upwards of 100 vehicles parked up on the edge of town
sites.  Yet more than two years ago the travellers told the Council that small
sites were the only viable way forward. That advice was disregarded and large
sites allowed to develop. Now they are to be hounded out of town as a result.<p>
Steve Bassam once wrote to Justice? and said there needed to  be &quot;a
campaign of rage against the CJA&quot;. Now he sings a very different tune -
one which is most discordant with his past as a squatter. Where he once saw
diversity as a virtue, now it is an eye sore and an impediment to a future of
squeaky-clean New Labour rigid conformity. Susan Hannis from Brighton Friends,
Families and Travellers (BFFT) said: &quot;This is a medieval approach which
will not solve anything. You don't evict a whole estate because one person had
a noisy party.&quot; There have only been three parties on sites in two and a
half years. <p>
 Bassam has told travellers there will be no eviction without liaison with
police but the only communication so far has been legal documents pinned to a
board. Hundreds of riot cops have been on the hill, and helicopters fly over
the site.<p>
The eviction of the travellers has wider implications- not least because it'll
be a test case for New Labour. Twelve vehicles, who left the Horsdean site for
some peace and quiet, have been given their Criminal Justice Act marching
orders <em>three times</em>  in the past two weeks - each time videoed and
documented by police.  One traveller - Whitney - attempted to run his vehicle
through a road block. It was  impounded for three months, and he's  being
charged &#163;<em>100 a day</em> for the police to look after it. Nice!
<h3>
<A NAME="comedown">PARTY COME DOWN</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;The vast majority of people on the site had no prior
knowledge of the party or involvement with it. The sound systems which came
onto the site were not Travellers, nor were the people who attended the party.
We did not want this invasion - 99% were strangers who treated the travellers
and the site with utter disrespect...The people who wanted the party at the
weekend are now safely back in their homes, whilst we as a community are left
to pick up the pieces and their rubbish.&quot;<br>- </em><strong>Statement by

<A NAME="builder">Builder From Lewes</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>SchNEWS reader Al Baker, who squatted the Brent Spar (twice)
and evaded crack French commandos in Mururoa against nuclear testing, has found
a new home ... a rock in the North Atlantic! Al, our favourite builder from
Lewes, is holed up in a survival capsule with two others on Rockall, an
isolated speck of land 300 miles off the west coast of Scotland. Why?
Greenpeace, who are behind the action, said: &quot;We have asked the UK
Government to stop oil exploration in the Atlantic Frontier region and when
they do they can have their rock back.&quot; Al, who we can exclusively reveal
had Pollok (a fish) for his tea last night, says: &quot;By seizing Rockall we
claim her seas for the planet and all its peoples. No one has the right to
unleash this oil into our threatened climate.&quot; It is said that more people
have landed on the moon than on Rockall. So SchNEWS says: Al we need a tad more
than a stamp donation to keep on helicoptering  over your subscription. Please
send more dosh. Over. Oh, and good luck!

<A NAME="sidmouth">Dripping Tree Causes Fire</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Things are really kickin' off in Sidmouth, Devon, where an oak
tree is depositing sap and leaves <em>all over  someone's </em> <em>garden</em>
. Disgraceful! So it's just as well that Sidmouth Town Council swung into
action to cut off the offending limbs. However, ex-Raving Loony Green Giant
Peoples Party councillor and tree surgeon Hawk, deciding the amputation would
affect the natural  balance of the tree, set up perhaps one of the smallest
tree camps <em>ever</em>.<em>  </em>He told SchNEWS, &quot;How would
<em>you</em>   like it if someone cut your limbs off ?&quot; <em> </em>However,
local residents weren't happy and took some of their own direct action by
setting fire to the tree house and badly scorching the tree.  Hawk was later
arrested for allegedly threatening to cause damage to a nearby house. <p>
Latest news is that our avenging arboreaculturalist went to court on Tuesday
for committal; the case is being sought against him whilst the unidentified
arsonist remains unpursued. This has led the bough- befriender to accuse Devon
and Cornwall Constabulary of  &quot;corruption and conspiracy&quot;. The tree
refused to comment.

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>8am Friday: Matt's been down the Cakehole tunnel at
<strong>Manchester Airport</strong> for TWO WEEKS! Muppet Dave came out on
Wednesday after a 12 days internment, following mother-to-be Denise who came
out after ten days. Down is clearly the way up! Many airport protesters have
now landed at <strong>Lyminge Forest</strong>, where seven camps - growing
daily - have been set up to rankle Rank who wanna build a massive artificial
holiday park to replace the lovely ancient old one. Stop the chop and get

<A NAME="quarries">Mendips/Whatley</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Three people charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage
at Whatley Quarry  have had their trial delayed until July 22nd. Richard Dixon
(ex-Lib Dem councillor for E. Mendip) had all the paperwork to the quarry
protests nicked in a house raid, delaying his quest to get a High Court
injunction to stop the quarry extension. He lost, but an important legal
precedent was set - `cos he was accepted as a &quot;suitable person&quot; to
challenge the quarry, an honour usually extended only to close neighbours  to
such sites. Whatley is just the tip of the Mendips iceberg as far as quarrying
goes. If plans for the Bulls Green Link Road go through, it'll provide the
perfect route for lorries carrying stone for road projects, allowing other
quarries in the area to expand. As there's only a remote chance that financing
will stumble, it looks like there's only one way to stop it. More details: The

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>HE'S BACK!: He may be de-selected but he sure ain't dead: yes,
the Portillo rides again. Those watching items about the  Tory leadership
contest on ITN news last Tues were no doubt gratified to have such insipid fare
spiced up by a troupe of comedy Spaniards, replete with sombreros and ponchos,
who disrupted the live reports with upbeat fiesta music and a selection of
placards reading &quot;Portillo 4 El Presidente&quot; and &quot;Portillo, he
kick your ass&quot;. Rumours had it that disaffected Young Conservatives were
to blame, but it turns out that a comedy cable TV network were responsible,
because they &quot;<em>liked the idea of being able to represent someone who is
not even eligible to stand.</em>&quot; Elsewhere, distraught fans of the ousted
F&uuml;hrer of Enfield, have resorted to leaving messages in the pigeonhole of
Stephen Twigg, the Labour MP who defeated him. &quot;<em>Do you realise what
you've done to the Tory party and, ultimately, to British democracy?</em>&quot;
they whine... And finally, best wishes to Michael Howard who's had a really top
week. First of all he discovered was about as popular as er... Michael Howard
in the Tory leadership election. Then, on Thurs the House of Lords found him
guilty of giving too severe a sentence to the killers of James Bulger. SchNEWS
wondered  how many times he's been found guilty of  things, but now it doesn't
really matter. Nice one Mickey, you psychopathic has-been, perhaps we'll see
<em>you</em> slopping out on the new prison ship now your mantle of power`s
gone. Generally, it's nice to see that all is well in that fringe pressure
group talking shop that is the Conservative Party.
