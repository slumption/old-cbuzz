<h2>
<A NAME="laws">WELCOME TO... 'DEMOCRACY'</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&#34;Taken together, the new provisions of the Police
Act, the Knives Act, and the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act are
least as nasty as anything in the Criminal Justice Act. The bugging and
burgling provisions are now well-known - but that's just the start. Employers
will be able to insist that job applicants provide information about unspent
convictions, and, more worryingly, non-conviction information such as cautions,
bind-overs, or even any old unsubstantiated gossip from local police files.
Stop and search powers will be increased, so that when the police have reason
to believe that some people in their area may be carrying knives, they can stop
and search anyone. The DSS will be able to swap information with other
government departments, not just in specific cases where they suspect fraud,
but in order to `check the accuracy of records' in general.&#34;</em><br>
<strong>- Liberty</strong><p>
<strong></strong>Welcome to democracy... on the last day of parliament 27 bills
became law - in just one minute. Here's a taster of what's too come...
<h3>
<A NAME="laws1">The Police Act</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong>Bugging and burgling of anyone suspected of a serious offence.</strong>
This is defined as <em>&#34;a large number of persons in pursuit of a common
purpose.&#34;</em> According to Lord Hutchinson that will mean <em>&#34;the
protesters involved in the miner's strike, Greenham Common, Newbury and the
Poll Tax would all be criminals under this act!&#34;</em><p>
<em></em><strong>Sponsorship of the National Crime Unit and National Crime
Squad. </strong>And who can sponsor them? Anyone!!! <em>&#34;Acceptance of
gifts and loans, in connection with the discharge of any of its functions,
accept gifts of money, and gifts or loans of other property, on such terms as
appear to the Authority to be appropriate.&#34;</em><p>
<strong>Certificates of Criminal Records. </strong>In 1990, the House of
Commons home affairs committee heard evidence that the criminal records
provided to the courts were inaccurate, incomplete, out of date and contained
extraneous or prejudicial material. The solution? Any person going for a job
will have to produce a <em>&#34;Certificate of Criminal Records&#34;</em>
(costing &#163;15) if asked by a prospective employee.<p>
Most women in prison are in for fine default - 68% for not having a TV licence!
34% of men under 35 have a criminal record. 
<h3>
<A NAME="laws2">Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>This Act lets cops determine what material will be disclosed
to the defence, (you can just imagine them trashing their own case, can't you?)
they could burgle a defence lawyer's office or home, snatch the papers, then
refuse to disclose them! If this had been law years back the Bridgewater Three
and Guildford Four would all still be inside.
<h3>
<A NAME="laws3">Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>This changes the rules relating to privacy and data
protection. The changes will allow the government to trawl through the files
held on each of us by every department to look for inconsistencies. A mismatch,
an error, an offence, an unpaid bill will domino through the system. Tax,
driving licence, social security, National Insurance. It's the civil servants'
snoopers' charter.<p>
<em>&#34;Data matching is the hi-tech equivalent of a general warrant on the
entire population,&#34;</em> says Simon Davies of Privacy International. <em>&#34;It
is no different to the notion of police being empowered to enter your home in
your absence, search through your papers and take what they wish. It vastly
increases the power of the state.&#34;</em><p>
This silent, invisible data watching is worrying because in 1994, there were
655 reported incidents of Whitehall employees using their passwords to access
records to pass to outsiders. Maybe to the sponsors of
the <A HREF="http://www.open.gov.uk/ncis/ncishome.htm" TARGET="new">National
Criminal Intelligence Service</A>, huh?
<h3>
<A NAME="laws4">Public Entertainments Licences (Drug Misuse) Act</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Gives the police new powers to close a club immediately if
they <em>suspect </em>drug use/dealing is going on in the venue or at
<em>&#34;any place nearby which is controlled by the holder of the
licence.&#34;</em>
<h3>
<A NAME="laws5">Crime (Sentences) Act</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Among other things means... Minimum 3 years for repeat
burglars - Minimum 7 years for repeat drug dealers - Automatic life for repeat
serious sex and violent offenders - Abolition of automatic 50 % parole - ban on
under 18s drinking in public - discretionary naming of juveniles. This takes no
account of changing circumstances. For example, a woman could get a mandatory
life sentence for responding to years of domestic violence if she had a
previous conviction for violence, even if that happened years before, and a
third conviction for burglary could carry a heavier sentence than a first for
rape.
<h3>
<A NAME="laws6">Knives Act</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Allows a police superintendent or above who &#34;reasonably
believes&#34; that there will be serious violence to give authority to stop
and search. Following such a decision, the police don't need to have a reason
to search an individual! Home Office statistics show that even where the police
have to justify a search on the basis of reasonable suspicion, a
disproportionate number of ethnic minorities find themselves targeted. Read
Simon Davies' book <em>&#34;Big Brother - Britain's web of surveillance and
the new technological order&#34;</em>, &#163;5.99, Pan.

<A NAME="schorts">SchORTS (it's nearly summer!)</A></h2>

<UL>
<LI>Alison Halford, former Assistant Chief Constable of
Merseyside has taken her own force to the European Commission for bugging her
while she was pursuing a claim for sexual discrimination against them. She
believes that while under surveillance, all dialogue with the Equal
Opportunities Commission, lawyers &amp; friends was tapped and taped. If her
complaint is upheld, bang goes (official) bugging in the UK! Judgement expected
in a couple of months.
<LI>Charles Pollard, Chief Constable of Thames Valley and a former deputy
assistant commissioner of the Met, said on Wednesday that Zero tolerance
policing has and will continue to lead to riots.

<A NAME="silence">Auntie SchNEWS</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Write this on the back of your solicitors card in case of
arrest and quote to the police <em>&#34;By denying a suspect the right to
silence the British Government and the police are breaching article 14 of the
United Nations Convention of Human Rights which guarantees the presumption of
innocence and the right not to bear testimony against oneself.&#34;</em>  That
is all you have to say.

<h2>
<A NAME="death">Party Death</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Sixty-one  year old Ian Grant died last weekend after being
attacked by eight policemen when a party in Putney was besieged by 50+ riot
police. Mr Grant fell and broke his nose before finally dying of a
haemorrhage.<p>
On the Saturday police had told organisers that they could have the premises
until Sunday night, one commenting<em>&#34;You lot have been lucky this
time!&#34;</em>  But by 4:30pm the next day with just 40 people left, riot
police equipped in bullet proof vests with police dogs and electric nooses
stormed the building. <em>&#34;It was totally over the top. The sound systems
were closing and we were just sitting out in the sun, relaxing.&#34;</em><p>
One girl was pushed over and one party-goer spread-eagled on the floor with
police kneeling on his back. It was at this point that Ian Grant was
grabbed.<em>&#34;It was when the police let me go that I first noticed the
body. He was lying by the door with cuts on his face and bruises all over. Six
policemen were trying to resuscitate him. I knew straight away he was
dead&#34;</em>  one eye-witness told SchNEWS.<p>
Battersea Coroners office told SchNEWS that he <em>&#34;died quite
naturally&#34; </em> and as there is <em>&#34;nothing sinister&#34;
</em>about his death. But the police have already changed their story twice. <p>
Scotland Yard told us 13 were arrested on drugs charges (though we has hear
that it was only 7, the remaining 6 being charged with Public Order and
Affray), 4 were bailed, and there was a death that was <em>&#34;unrelated to
the party.&#34;</em>  The pathologist is claiming that the haemorrhage was
caused by a weak artery of the heart. The police may be right - it wasn't so
much the party that caused the death as the police intervention the next day.
<p>
<strong>SchNEWS offers all the friends and family of Ian Grant our deepest
sympathy.</strong><p>
<em>In order for an inquiry to occur more eye-witness accounts
are needed. If
you saw anything ring SchNEWS and we will pass on the info.</em>

and Gary found himself sleeping rough and borrowing produce from shops (without
asking), got caught and sent down. <em>&#34;I'm not proud of the fact I had to

<A NAME="raids">Chichester Raids</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Three addresses in Chichester were raided by Hampshire Police
this week. They were after information about the recent Chiddingfold Hunt Ball,
and the upcoming demo at Shoreham on May 16th. However, two of these addresses
were out of date, and they ended up bursting in a family having tea, and a
Student Union Office! At the third address, a known hunt sab was questioned and
released without charge. Hampshire Police are famous for setting the Animal
Rights National Index to gather info on protesters, and taking the
&#34;Gandalf 6&#34; to Court on conspiracy charges. For more info contact

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>SchNEWS readers will be horrified by the following tragic tale
from this weeks Police Review.  A Kent cop, returning to the station after
spraying toxic chemicals in the face of some unfortunate citizen, took his
gloves off and went to the little plods' room to empty his bladder. Whereupon
he sustained burns to his love truncheon as the CS residue on his hands began
to react. His pride then suffered a further knock when he had to fill out a
`hurt on duty' form - including diagrams of how the damage was done...

thousand more repressive measures becoming law. Always take time out for
yourself. Try to grow some food, plant some trees and go for long walks in the
countryside. Then you will feel refreshed and ready once more to fight for a
better world. Which will still be legal, honest.<p>
