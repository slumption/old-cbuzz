<h2>
<A NAME="consort">WHAT A GAS!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;One demonstrator was held in a headlock and sprayed
inches from her eyes; she was then held by the arms and sprayed a further three
times, then she was dragged on her back scraping a large area of skin off. She
thought she was going to die.&quot;</em><br>
<strong>- Eyewitness</strong><p>
<em></em>&quot;<em>This  is what you get for coming here you
bastards</em>.&quot;<br>
<strong>- West Mercia cop to  protestor</strong><p>
The second major demonstration against Consort, beagle breeders for
vivisection, near Hereford last Sunday saw over 100 West Mercia police again
indiscriminately using CS gas and thuggery against over 200 protestors,
resulting in one having her arm broken, another her hand and 38 arrested on
charges ranging from sections 2 to 5. An elderly Portsmouth protestor was
truncheoned in the back of the head and knocked into a barbed wire fence and a
17 year old girl was savaged in the thigh  by a police dog, which then injured
another protestor before finally  doing the decent thing and attacking its
handler. Veteran activist Helen Nelson said the day began peacefully enough,
despite  police blocking the bridle path bordering the compound: <em>&quot;Then
riot police started coming down the hill, as others came running up from
below, and tthey suddenly charged, pushing people all over the place, whacking
them with truncheons and kicking out with their boots.&quot;</em>  Helen, 71,
then received the blow to her head - explained by the cops to the press as `a
brick thrown by other protestors' - which resulted in her being hospitalized
along with the bitten girl. After being discharged, Helen was duly nicked and
charged with affray!<p>
Activists moved on to the nearby home of  Gordon Gilder - an  animal
transportation scumbag - to be met by more police who opened up with  CS gas,
deciding  a table-top pepper pot held by one demonstrator constituted a full-on
assault with pepper sprays.  Police guidelines state that CS is to be used
`only in life threatening situations' and  then from a distance of no less than
2 m. `Life-threatening' in this situation  included leaning on a gate - 5
people were sprayed point-blank in the face for this misdemeanour - and facing
the wrong direction: <em>&quot;One bloke was tapped on the shoulder and then
gassed in the face when he turned round&quot;</em> an ALF spokesman told
Schnews. He added: <em>&quot;Police were seen tipping the canisters upside
down, trying to shake the last drops out, they'd used so much.&quot;</em><p>
<em></em>Some activists didn't even get to make it to Gilder's: a vanload
enjoying a cuppa at a roadside services were suprised by riot cops who pushed
the protesting owner  aside and marched in to nick them. All those arrested
during the day were processed with catatonic slowness, some not being released
until the following evening; most have been bailed until June and further
arrests are feared. Some - hunt sabs and Shoreham activists - reported that
police singled them out for arrest at the first opportunity and those with
video cameras were surrounded by  teams who tried to sieze the equipment,
damaging it in the process. And Lewes Coaches, the company who has regularly
transported Shoreham activists to Consort demos, have since been `advised' by
the force to cease this trade forthwith or have their vehicles continuously
pulled by traffic division....
<ul>
<li>	Helen Nelson wants witnesses to her assault: phone the Justice? office.
<li>	Sussex activists have announced a demo outside Consort director Peter
Savage's house in Upper Beeding. Meet in the village 10am, June 1st.
<li>	NEXT NATIONAL CONSORT DEMO JULY 6TH: Consort Kennels, Harewood End (on the
A49 between Ross and Hereford), 12pm. BE THERE!</ul>

<A NAME="crap">Crap Arrest of the Week</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>For possession of myrrh! Head Mix Collective, on tour in Wales
a few days ago , were pulled over by Aberwystwyth's finest. Finding out they
were a band and obviously up to no good they searched the van from top to
bottom and found some..... medicinal myrrh. Unused to alternative remedies,
they proceeded to arrest the owner and seize the van, refusing to release
either until 3 hours after the gig was meant to begin. Good job Jesus wasn't
born in Wales!

<A NAME="bolin">Skyjack!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>&quot;<em>Without the existence of the tunnels and tree camps,
Bolin Valley would have been flattened long ago. Direct Action has yet again
catapulted the issue of unsustainability into the mainstream
agenda.</em>&quot;<br>
<strong>- Manchester activist</strong><p>
Tuesday 4am, and the protests camps along the proposed second runway at
Manchester Airport have  unwanted guests. 100's of security, Sheriff's
officers, police, scab climbers and pot-holers surround and invade the  camps
at Bolin Valley, Cheshire. <p>
`Operation Fulcrum' is in full effect. People take to the tunnels and trees as
camps such as Sir Cliff Richard OBE Vegan Revolutionary brace themselves for
what could be the longest evictions in post-war Britain. <p>
A full square mile has been cordoned off, adding to the 4 miles of razor
fencing around the site. Under-Sheriff Randall Hibbert won't allow independent
legal observers on site and his arrogance was highlighted by an  assistant who
said,<em> &quot;On this site, Mr Hibbert is God.&quot;</em><p>
Ex-hostage Terry Waite led locals in their opposition to the building of the
runway. <em>&quot;There are fundamental issues of principle at stake here. The
legal process was loaded in favour of the developers from the start; this is
indicative of Britain's ailing planning system.&quot;</em> he said.<p>
As SchNEWS went to press, no camp had been cleared, although our last contact
with the site told of a general sense of bedlam ...<p>
SchNEWS would hate to bore you with the reasons the proposed runway should not
go ahead, but:
<ul>
<li>	One transatlantic return flight uses up half a person's yearly CO2
emissions.
<li>	The DoT have forecast a 163% increase in air transport in the next 12
years.
<li>	UK internal flights are on average 5 times more polluting than the
equivalent train journey. </ul><strong>BADDIES:</strong>

<A NAME="party">Party and Protest!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Remember, boys `n' girls, your rights to party and festy on
down are being eroded even as we speak. There's lots of spot on groups doing
their damnedest to put on some wicked events this summer, and it is your moral
duty to support them and have a bloody good time! Here is the first bit of the
definitive SchNEWS festy list for the summer!
<h3>
<A NAME="tips">Do's and Don'ts</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Despite the best efforts of the authorities, people are still
putting on free parties up and down the country. Here's a does and don'ts list
in case you happen to stumble across one:
<ol>
<li>	Be prepared to be self-sufficient. Facilities could be minimal.
<li>	Park sensibly, keep site roads clear.
<li>	Be friendly to local residents, ramblers etc. Smile - you're at a Free
Party!
<li>	Bury your shit!
<li>	Don't trash the site - take a binbag.
<li>	Fires - use dead <strong>not</strong> live wood (which doesn't burn
anyway).
<li>	Make a donation - if someone passes a bucket round don't be a mean git. It
costs money to put on free parties.
<li>	Know your rights - Get yourself a BUST CARD: 10p from Release, Advice Line
0171 729 9904. Emergency  Help Line 0171 603 8654
<li>	Enjoy yourself!!!!</ol>

<A NAME="rts">Off the Buses</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>A bugle call at 1pm heralded the start of Sheffield's
first-ever RTS, and 800 activists and revellers moved from Devonshire Green to
meet with the Desert Storm and Spoof sound systems on Charter Road dual
carriageway; the traffic got jammed and the party was on! Twenty cyclists
engaged in a spot of spontaneous mid-afternoon action and blocked a roundabout
for nearly an hour and at 5pm the whole bash shifted back to Devonshire Green
and people danced on into the evening. The District Commander of South
Yorkshire cops, Steven King,  sent a letter to organisers beforehand pleading
for co-operation and asking them to put aside &quot;pre-conceived
prejudices&quot; about the boys in blue<em> (their arrest of two on drug
charges and one for `falling through a car window' must be totally out of
character, then) </em>and local rag `The Sheffield Star' chose to concentrate
on the plight of an elderly resident, unversed in RTS tactics, who was reduced
to tears of confusion by the resultant bus diversions.

<strong></strong>SchNEWS was sooo concerned to find out that the curse of the
huge moles hit the garden of another open-cast mining advocate last Saturday
night. Readers will remember that the burrowing pests hit Michael Heseltine's
Northampton garden last year, and we have learnt that they have hit again at
the garden of Richard Budge - the arrogant bully boy boss of RJB mining. These
little rodents are so clever that they can throw paint around in a random
fashion, to spell out phrases such as `No Opencast', `Budge Is The Pits' and
`Who R U Going 2 Injunct 4 This Then?' Enquiries about opencast mining should
be directed to Worksop Police Station or the Freemason's Hall directly opposite!
