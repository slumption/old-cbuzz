"I repeat that we all stand before history.  I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial.  Shell's day will surely come for there is no doubt in my mind that the ecological war that the company has waged in the delta will be called to question and the crimes of that war  be duly punished."<br> <i>Ken Saro-Wiwa at his trial.</i>
<p>11.30 am Port Harcourt Prison, south-east Nigeria. Ken Saro-Wiwa,  Dr.Barinen Kiobel, John Kpuinen, Baribor  Bera, Saturday Dobee, Felix Nuate, Nordu Eawoh, Paul Levurah and Daniel Gbokoo are hung.<p>
Last Friday in a two fingers gesture to the world, the Nigerian military regime put to death nine people who paid the ultimate price for  campaigning for the most basic of human rights:  the right for clean air, land and water for the Ogoni people of the Nigeria delta. <p> 
It took five bungled attempts to hang Ken Saro Wiwa.  His final words "What country is this? What are you doing to me?"  should be shoved down the throats  of the Commonwealth governments who only offered gentle persuasion' to the Nigerian dictatorship not to carry out the death penalty and Shell Oil, who  expressed its "deep regret" but in the next breathe, indicated it would press ahead with fresh investments in Nigeria. This said the Nigerian government vindicates the executions.'<p>
"The Ogoni land is one of the most polluted places on the planet with gas fires burning 24 hours a day, fountains of oil pouring into villagers fields, contaminated water, leaking pipelines, pools of sulphur and drainage problems... The land is so devastated environmentally that fishermen and farmers cannot sustain their lives."
In 1989 in despair at the continuing destruction of their land Ken Saro-Wiwa, well-known author and play-wright, established the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), demanding autonomy for their region and a fair share of oil wealth.<p>
Shell are the biggest oil firm in the country currently producing 900,000 barrels a day in Nigeria, half the country's output.  In a country where 80 per cent of the government's revenue comes from oil, it is  Shell's contribution that helps to prop up the military regime. <br> 
In January 1993, 300,000 Ogoni staged a peaceful protest to coincide with the start of the world year of indigenous people. As the protests escalated Shell had to pull out of Ogoni land. A leaked memo stated that operations were still impossible "unless ruthless military operations are undertaken for smooth economic activities to commence."  Later that year military force was used in a series of brutal attacks which left 750 Ogoni  dead and 30,000 homeless.  In May 94  Saro-Wiwa was imprisoned by the military police on fabricated charges of murder - he spent 63 of these days in chains.  Two weeks all nine were sentenced to death.<p>
"Shell had ample opportunity to demonstrate concern over the 17 months of my fathers incarceration and trial. They chose to maintain their cosy relationship with the military dictatorship to secure oil profits rather than condemn, the brutal and unjust arrest and later sentencing on non-violent environmental campaigners."
Indeed minutes released between the Nigerian High Commissioner and four senior oil executives at the Shell Centre in London showed no attempt to intervene on the activists behalf.  The sole topic was how to handle the bad publicity.  When Ken Saro-Wiwa was indited for murder, Shell said the verdict was not its concern...<p>
"The flames of Shell are flames of Hell,<br>
We bask below their light<br>
Nought for us to serve the blight <br>
Of cursed neglect and cursed Shell."<br>
<i>Ogoni song.</i><p>
The deaths have outraged the whole world.  People are being urged to boycott Shell but "Shells Nigeria actions are indicative of the nature of multinational companies.  Through the exploitation of oil, the Ogoni's chief livelihood, their land, is being poisoned.  Soon they will have no choice but to become players in the economic system from which Shell derives it dominance. ."<p>
Shell's gross income for 1990 was 132 billion - more than Tanzania, Ethiopia, Napal, Bangladesh, Zaire, Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan combined!  500 million people, 10% of the worlds population, live in these countries.<p>
PEOPLE NOT PROFITS<br>
The whole issue brings into question the way our world is run and controlled by  huge multinational companies: unaccountable and uncaring, continually over-riding the wishes of people and the planet in their ruthless quest for profits.  <br>Boycott Shell - but then what?  Oil companies the world over are devastating the environment and displacing people.   It must go further than a simple boycott.  It must be about challenging the way the world is being destroyed for greed by a few.  <br>So where to do we begin?  Get yourself informed, get yourself active.  Fight back - as well as working towards sustainable lifestyles.
<p>"The power wielded by these organisations is greater than that of many, if not all governments and makes a mockery of certain countries claims to democracy...multinationals are beholden neither to local communities nor to national electorates, but can dictate policy through their control of markets and the economic havoc they can cause by withdrawing support from a government.  As such, they are the chief obstacle to the resolution of our environmental and social problems."   <br>
70% of all trade is now controlled by just 500 corporations. 
<p>On the Friday spontaneous actions at Newbury, Oxford, Cambridge and Brighton took place at Shell garages, along with a demonstration of 150 writers outside the Nigerian embassy.  People were nicked outside the embassy after locking on to the railings.  Giving the names of the nine Ogoni killed they were charged for trespassing on diplomatic territory and kept in the cells for 26 hours for their troubles.<p>

Yet again the race card is being played by the Conservatives. The Asylum and Immigration Bill is just part of the package to ensure electoral success.  The Bill (presently in its early stages) will be accompanied by an aptly named white list' - countries considered by the Home Office to be safe and to which asylum seekers from that country will be automatically deported back.<br>The list is believed to include Sri Lanka, Algeria, Bulgaria, Turkey, Poland and Nigeria - though the latter would now surely be impossible to include due to last weeks executions. Since the Nigerian military annulled the presidential elections in June 93 out of 9,000 Nigerians who have applied to Britain for asylum, only 4 have been granted refugee status and 15 exceptional leave to remain.<p>
Many of these so called safe' countries have severe human rights abuses and/or  civil wars. Many people have already been deported back into the arms of dictatorships to face imprisonment, torture, even death. 
Despite an arms embargo by the British and US Government against Nigeria - sales continue. The recent sale of 80 British tanks are classed as non lethal - are they to be used for stockcar racing?<p>
DSS workers, already being used by the government to implement the hated JobSeekers Allowance are, along with teachers, NHS staff and council workers to be held responsible for checking the immigration status of the public and to grass on any suspect illegal immigrants. Obviously black and Asian people will be targeted for harassment and could be refused services until the immigration checks are complete.  If a racist is working in the public sector they will have the power to deny benefits, housing, medical assistance, teaching etc. <p>
In October Peter Lilley the Social Security Secretary, announced the abolition of benefits for Asylum seekers.  Using the if we can't kick em out, then let's starve them out' approach the treasury will save an estimated �150- 200 million.  Most Asylum seekers find it virtually impossible to find jobs due to prejudice and their uncertain immigration status, combined with the fact the for the first six months asylum seekers can't legally look for work.  For the 30,000 + people affected it will cut off their only lifeline.<p>
The Bill  also threatens to fine employers who have taken on illegal immigrants, giving rise to more discrimination.  Already the unemployment rate for blacks and Asians is 18.8% - more than double that of whites.  On average Afro-Caribbean's earn 98p less than whites and Pakistanis and Bangladeshis �2.52 less per hour!<br>
Fact: There are more people leaving Britain each year than coming in.  Can you blame them?<p>

<center><H3>DISGRACEFUL SCENES</H3></center><p>

The great traditions of British democracy were disgracefully flouted this week when a small group of nasty extremists protested outside the state opening of parliament - simply because the government is bringing a new racist law (the Asylum Bill) that will mean starvation and death for thousands of asylum seekers.
Do these protesting yobs care nothing for great British traditions such as the state opening of parliament - and state racism? In a particularly disgraceful scene the miscreants threw paint over Brian Mawhinney, the chairman of the Conservative Party, forcing him to go into a TV discussion without his rather wet jacket. Just as well Labour Party deputy leader John Prescott was in the studio to join Mr Mawhinney in roundly condemning the "violence" of these cowardly paint-throwers. A government that refuses entry to families fleeing war and genocide is one thing, but an anti-racist demonstrator throwing coloured liquid at a fellow politician - that really does need condemning!

<p>
British families spend nearly as much on armaments each week as they do on food (about �40 - what do you mean you didn't get a rocket launcher from your local corner shop this week?) 1 in 10 jobs in this country are linked in some way to the 'defence' industry. Britain is said to be on the verge of bankruptcy and yet there is still plenty of cash swilling around so that John Major can play soldiers. Perhaps 'our' most controversial arms producer is British Aerospace (BAe), who in 1993 signed a contract with Indonesia's military government to sell them 24 Hawk aircraft.<br>
"Four of my cousins were killed in Hawks attacks near Los Palos.  They are perfect for moving in and out of the mountains.  They have a terrible sound when they are coming in to bomb, like a voice wailing. We immediately go to the caves, into the deepest ones because their bombs are so powerful.  They fly in low...and attack civilians.  Most people in east Timor know about the British Hawks."<br>
Indonesia invaded the neighbouring country of East Timor in 1975 and since then a third of the population (200,000) have been massacred. There is solid evidence to show that Hawks have been used in bombing raids on civilians. Four years ago this week the town of Dili was attacked and this Sunday (12th) there will be protests outside the Indonesian Embassy, Grosvenor Square, London.<br>
There has been lots of action against British Aerospace over the years, and has in recent times been increasing in its frequency and intensity with occupations, die ins, lobbies and vigils. BAe's Annual General Meeting this year was a most jolly event as shareholders tried to lock themselves to Chairman Bob Bauman's microphone stand. BAe have wielded the stick with injunctions against protestors including Chris Cole who spent six months inside for the smashing of nose cones of the aircraft .<br>
There can be few more disgraceful acts on this earth than profiting at the expense of the deaths of innocent men, women and children, and that is exactly what BAe are doing. <br>Let's make sure that in future it's us that give them a rocket!!

Two well-to-do landowners from Newbury petrol bombed a sleeping family in their coach at the Redden's Copse site, one of the camps set up to fight the proposed town's by-pass. <br>Jerry, Amanda (who is pregnant) and Ben (6)  were woken by flames coming from their vehicle late one night. Two 'people' wearing balaclavas were seen driving away from the site. Their registration number was taken and the Boys in Blue arrested some real criminals (for a change).<br> 
The family were unharmed, but a spokesperson for the Third Battle of Newbury said of the attack. "It was only due to Jerry being awake that possible deaths were prevented.An action outside the court is guaranteed for when these inbred animals come to trial.

Squatters are winning the battle against the new Interim Possession Orders (I.P.O.'s), which came in 10 weeks ago under the Criminal Justice Act. (CJA.)  The I.P.O.'s were meant to make squatting harder by making it an imprisonable offence not to leave a building within 24 hours of being served one or to return within a year.  There's only been 4 cases since I.P.O.'s came in and the squatters have only lost once (because they didn't bother contesting it).

He came to this conclusion after the shambles at the C.J.B. demo last October, when riot police "seemed reluctant to withdraw" after being ordered to.  He noted the "indifference to evidence gathering and successful prosecution" during the demo.  Other new projects on the 'public order' front are a Public Order Intelligence System to gather info. on potential "trouble makers" and video cameras in riot shields so they can see what they're hitting.<br> On Wednesday people picketed the Management Summit 95" in London.  Top-notch executives from  a whole host of multi-murdering corporations  came to hear  speakers (on a mere �5,000 for a 40 minute chat) such as the president of McDonalds on "how to successfully manage the globalisation of corporations" or the head of Nestle, no doubt avoiding the issue of their companies relish in telling mothers from the third world that powered milk is better than breast. Or what about the MD of Minolta Europe, who sees every future market dominated by four of five global corporations, each "infinitely caring" for billions of customers. "Global corporations must love people". <br> Just like Shell love the Ogoni ...<p>
