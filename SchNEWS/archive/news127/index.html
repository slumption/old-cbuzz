<H2><A NAME="faceache"> FACEACHE</A></H2>

<EM> "By the year 2005, the face of every second adult in the UK will
be stored in a national government database."</EM> <STRONG>- Daily
Telegraph 22/7/97</STRONG>
<P>

What if SchNEWS told you that the world's most sophisticated database
of facial images was being set up in Britain...without any
legislation, parliamentary oversight or public consultation - not even
a polite chat with the Data Protection Registrar.  Welcome to the
ultimate I.D. card.  Last week the Home Office quietly announced that
as of October next year, photographs in all new passports will be
digitised and stored electronically. The old system of laminating a
physical photo into a passport will be replaced by a computer stored
image sprayed directly onto the passport with a laser jet. Yes, that
picture of you as a goofy fifteen year old with a manky haircut will
be reliably stored forever - unless they use the fancy new IBM
software that automatically ages your mugshot!<P>

3.5 million photo images together with related data
(personal and family details) will be stored each year on the
database, resulting in the creation within 10 years of a searchable
archive of 35 to 40 million people - even more than the conservative
evidence given by the Telegraph.  The Home Office says the new
passport will be quicker to process and more resistant to tampering,
but Dr James Backhouse, director of the Computer Security Research
Centre in the London School of Economics said <EM> "The mere existence of
such a large and sensitive database invites all manner of
threats. Digital images can be transmitted, analysed and matched just
like any other data. My own view is that the development of this
system should proceed with meticulous care and its planning should be
subject to thorough public oversight".</EM><P>

   A spokesman for the Home Office said the system would be 
operated in strict accordance with the Data Protection Act. But John
Woulds, assistant Data Protection Registrar said the project was <EM>"in a
different league" </EM> to most other databases, and his office <EM>"we've not
consulted formally or informally about this." </EM>

The Passport agency systems are linked to a number of agencies
including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and various Departments
 in the Home Office. Police are given access on request.<P>

Simon Davies of Privacy International
told SchNEWS <EM> "Although the Database will be managed by the Passport
Agency it is in effect a Home Office facility.  As a law enforcement
tool it will be a choice prize not just for police, but also for
security services such as MI5."</EM>  The Home Office would not comment on
the potential use of this technology, but it insisted that the new
database was a necessary step to combat passport fraud. However,
neither the Home Office nor the Passport Agency were able to provide
any fraud estimates to justify the system.  The Home Office suggested
that the Passport Agency <EM>"may have done some work on this".</EM>  However,
the Agency is not responsible for such investigations.<P>


<h3>Smile For The Cameras - It's CCTV Face Recogition Time </h3>

The potential to automatically match digitised passport images with
photos from existing police databases and CCTV cameras is at the head
of a barrage of privacy concerns. Several companies are well on the
way to developing such technology. Miros Inc. has developed a system
that can compare, in under a second, an image from a standard security
camera with stored images.  The TrueFace system developed by Miros has
been installed in 80 locations around the world.  It claims to have
only a 0.1 percent rejection rate, using an ordinary video camera
lined to any PC. <P>

Most automatic face recognition systems use
"landmarks" on the face (eyes, mouth etc) or a combination with
"eigenfaces" which measure the difference between light and
shade. Adding or removing spectacles or facial hair makes only
marginal difference to the system's accuracy.  Already Manchester City
use face recognition at their Maine Road football ground and if
Heathrow airport gets the green light for Terminal 5, they will use
automatic face recognition, technology which has been part-funded by
Marks and Spencers, the Police Foundation and British Aerospace. <P>

<H3> Run To The Woods! </H3>

So should we be getting our knickers in a twist? Simon
Davies told us, <EM>"It's always been the wet dream of authority to link
faces with data and this will be a red letter day for them. The fraud
argument is a confidence trick as the new passports will be just as
easy to forge. The only winners will be the police, security services
and anybody else - except of course ordinary people."</EM><P>

  In the very
near future we could see a triad working together of passport,
digitalised driving licences and banks all feeding into the same
databases.  So why waste time with the political hot potato of ID
cards when you can sneak this all past the public behind closed doors.
And if that hasn't got you hiding all paranoid behind your settee then
there's always Europe. The Government is planning to join a massive
"state security" system targeting millions of European citizens as
part of a new drive to promote 'co-operation' between EU police and
intelligence agencies. The Schengen Information System (SIS) keeps
information on people regarded as a potential threat to public
order. This includes 'aliens, illegal immigrants, drug-traffickers,
serious crime suspects, football hooligans - and "meetings attended by
large numbers of people from more than one member state." These
include demonstrators, anti-roads campaigners- and of course rock
music fans.

After 15 years resistance to Britain's Polaris and Trident nukes, in
the form of halting convoys, boarding submarines and laughing off 1090
arrests the local council have served a notice to quit by the 28th
July.  Obviously the peace campers intend to stay, despite council
threats of issuing an eviction order.  Cash-strapped councillors have
admitted on Channel 5 News that if they were to face a Manchester
style eviction they would give up.  Bodies are needed to show the
strength of support on the 28th and to help build more defences, in
the form of tree houses, lock-ons etc...<P>

Trevor Coleman, Devon Under-sherrif - voted <EM"smug self-congratulatory
bastard of the week"</EM> in issue 105 for his part in the evicting of
Fairmile and other camps along the route of the A30 - is offering for
his new company, the Major Protest Response Unit, as part of
Michelmores Solicitors, to calculate the price of clearing protest
sites. The company's target market is developers tendering for
privately funded building projects, such as DBFO (Design, Build, Fund
and Operate) schemes threatening to harm environmentally sensitive
areas. The package offered by the Major Protest Response Unit
includes: assessment of accessibility of the site, whether there are
protected species on it, amount of local support, number of tunneling
and tree climbing specialists required, cost of security guards,
amount of specialist equipment required plus advice on how to obtain
posession orders, insurance and the VAT implications of the
Undersherrif executing various writs.<P>

In an interview Trevor Coleman warned, <EM>"Whenever there is a
sensitive road or construction site this sort of protest will
errupt. Environmental protesters are not going
away, in fact they are increasing their activities to include
construction as well as road building sites."</EM>  Ironically, Coleman,
who evicted A30 protesters earlier this year, is likely to have his
first business opportunity provided by the same group of people.
Watts Blake Bearne (WBB), an organisation building a quarry extention
in Devon, spent last Friday and Saturday in conference with Major
Protest Response Unit requesting advice on how to deal with protesters
who have recently set up camp on land they intend to destroy.  The
company is advising,<EM> "not to underestimate the campaigners and their
techniques for halting construction" </EM>HA!

Unit, being coordinated by Malcom Dixon, and Trevor Coleman, can be

Things aren't looking rosy at the 75th World Santa Claus Congress in
Copenhagen. Last year there were squabbles over where "he" really
lives, and further confrontations are expected this year. In a scene
reminscent of small left-wing groups, a breakaway group is holding a
rival conference nearby. It appears that in response to information
published in last week's SchNews about the Anarchist's Christmas
dinner on the 25th July, organised by Brighton's Anarchist Teapot
(18-19 Ship Street), various santas have picked up on the idea. A
breakaway faction of Santas at this year's conference will also be
pushing for Christmas to be moved to July.

The SchNEWS warns all readers not to have a face. Always wear a
balaclava when getting your passport photo done and carry a false
nose, moustache and glasses kit with you to protect your anonymity,
although people will then think you are Inspector Clouseau and ask you
for an autograph. Don't feel bad about being two, three or even four
faced. Then you will feel content. Honest.
