<A NAME="gorleben">ICH BIN FULL ON!</A></h2>

<EM>&quot;I've voted all my life. But never again. I'll never vote
again. They're all criminals and crooks. They talk about Hitler and complain
about the Nazis, but who sent all these forces here? They're as bad as the
Nazis.&quot;</EM>
<BR>
<strong>- A middle-aged German protestor.</strong><p>
<strong></strong>Six containers of highly radioactive waste on their way to a
storage depot to Gorleben. The biggest police mobilisation ever in peacetime
Germany, involving 30,000 riot police at a cost of $40 million.<p>
The third shipment to Gorleben in three years this week met with massive
opposition. Over 60% of the population wants the country's 19 nuclear stations
(generating a third of its electricity) closed down - and rather than sit on
their bums complaining about it, thousands decided to get into some full-on
direct action. From farmers to families, schoolkids to shopkeepers, everyone it
seemed wanted a piece of the action.<p>
Defying a decree banning demonstrations, ordinary people have burrowed under
the 12 mile road to Gorleben. Protesters have built tunnels at eleven points
along the route, to weaken the road and cause its collapse under heavy
traffic. Others have laid explosives on railway tracks and handcuffed or
cemented themselves to the line. Farmers in the region have welded tractors
together, while the local fire brigade has been refusing to provide water for
the police water cannon. Schoolkids staging sit-ins stuck two fingers up to the
district authorities who wanted the schools to accommodate the huge police
contingent, while shops and businesses in nearby Dannenberg closed down for the
day in protest.<p>
Meanwhile workers at the Gorleben temporary storage site and at a nearby
saltmine - which is being examined for its suitability as a permanent waste
depot - are being shunned by the local population.<p>
Many expressed anger at what they saw, as riot police - operating at a snail's
pace - bludgeoned their way through the mass resistance with water cannons and
truncheons. One newspaper commented, &quot;Tens of thousands of police may be
able to protect the transport, but they cannot persuade the people and they
can't cover up the inadequacy of German energy policy.&quot;<p>
The shipment finally reached its destination on Wednesday afternoon, not much
later than the authorities had originally anticipated.<p>
<em>&quot;We may not have halted the shipment, but look how much money was
spent on the police. The whole world now knows what is happening and will look
more closely at what happens in their own countries.&quot;</em><P>
Germany spends just &#163;7 million annually on alternative energy.<p>

<A NAME="png">Papua New Guinea</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;10,000 people have been killed since 1968 and
another 100,000 forced into concentration camps. With their freedom fighters
gone, the last of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) could be killed
next week.&quot;</em><p>
Last Wednesday a small but dedicated group of activists descended on the Papua
New Guinea High Commission in London to protest against the continuing war of
genocide being carried out against the people of Bougainville. For the past
nine years with a population of only 160,000 and an army with antique and
homemade guns made out of water, piping and planks, they have managed to keep
closed one of the biggest copper mines in the world. The mine - owned by the
biggest and most destructive mining company in the world, Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ)
- was destroying the land, environment, society and culture of the small
island.<p>
But these considerations were not high on the list of priorities for the Papua
New Guinea government who lay claim to the island (despite being 320 miles
away) and whose mine was accounting for around 45% of PNG's total export
earnings. They and RTZ have demanded action - and this has been backed by
&#163;150 million worth of aid from the Australian government. With
British-based mercenary company Sandline International hired by RTZ to murder
the few remaining BRA, time is running out for the islanders. For more info
call PaRTiZans on 0171 700 6189.<p>
Also readers, before voting for the Lib Dems <em>(or indeed anyone else)</em>,
bear in mind that their Campaigns Manager is the External Affairs director for
RTZ (0171 930 2399).

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>For saying George! A Sussex man protesting outside the home of
a Kent vet who signs live animal export certificates, was nicked for
&quot;causing alarm, distress and harassment&quot;. What did he do? He called a
police officer by his first name, so was duly taken down the nick and given
bail conditions not to go within a 20 mile radius of Dover.

<A NAME="bari">R.I.P. Judi Barri</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Judith Beatrice Bari, American Earth First!er, died peacefully
on March 2nd of the effects of breast cancer, aged 47. Throughout the course of
her life she was involved in anti-Vietnam War protest, abortion rights for
women, workers' rights and support for repressive regimes in Central America.
But it was while working as a construction carpenter that she began to wonder
about the beautiful tight-grained redwood boards she was hammering nails into.
When she learned they came from 1000-2000 year old trees, she resolved to help
preserve the remaining old-growth redwood forests.<p>
Bari was involved in the fight for sustainable logging, and protesting against
the devastation of the Pacific forests.<p>
She began a lawsuit against the FBI, after a 1990 car bombing which nearly
killed her. She was travelling with Darryl Cherney when a bomb blew up the car
she was driving and nearly killed them both. The blast smashed her pelvis in 10
places, fractured her spine, left her with a paralysed foot and caused
extensive tissue and nerve damage. The FBI insisted that she had blown herself
up with a device of her making, and charged her with the explosion as she was
recovering in hospital. The blast happened months after Bari and other Earth
First! activists began receiving anonymous death threats - apparently from
timber supporters. Counterfeit EF! press releases advocating violent tactics
were created by a pro-timber actvist group and circulated to workers and the
press by Pacific Lumber Company, among others, according to evidence developed
in Bari's ongoing lawsuit against the FBI. When she reported the threats, and
took the written ones to the police, she was told, &quot;When you turn up dead,
then we'll investigate.&quot;<p>
Her attorney claimed, <em>&quot;The bombing was a clear, carefully designed,
criminal attempt to stop and silence Judi Bari...to intimidate and weaken the
movement she and Darryl Cherney were part of.&quot;</em><p>
<em></em>Cherney has vowed that the lawsuit will continue.<p>
Betty Ball credited Bari with the feminization of Earth First!. <em>&quot;It
has been incredibly male-dominated prior to Judi's entrance. There were women
involved but none were as successful as Judi in putting the feminine spin into
it, and getting rid of some of the macho chest-beating that had been prevalent
in Earth First!. Judi's influence allowed many more women to get involved, in
more influential ways than had been possible previously. Judi also innately
understood the importance of community-based organising, as opposed to the
nomadic style that Earth First! had before that.&quot;</em><p>
<em></em>Bari asked that her friends get together for a party (the word she
chose) expected to happen next weekend.

<LI><strong></strong>	Chilean police stopped 49 motorists in Santiago for using
<strong>cellular phones</strong> while driving, only to find that a third were
pretending to talk on fake phones!<p>
<LI>	An elderly man injured when ice the size of a sack of potatoes fell from an
aircraft <strong>cannot sue</strong> for compensation - because he failed to
take the plane's registration number!<p>
<LI>	<strong>Conscious Cinema</strong> have produced an A4 sheet containing
&quot;Useful media numbers for people on actions!&quot; It gives TV and radio
newsroom numbers across the country, and you can get a copy by sending an SAE
to Justice?<p>
<LI>	Here at SchNEWS we're always asking for donations, and quite rightly so we
hear you cry. This week we are requesting heavyweight contributions to the
following freepost address: The Rt. Honorable Brian Mawhinney, <strong>FREEPOST
</strong>SW3225, London SW1P 3BR.<p>
<LI>	The first construction project to be completed under DFBO (the new public
money for private profit road building scheme) is the <strong>A1(M)
expansion</strong> - Alconbury to Peterborough. One end of the route falls in
John Major's constituency, the other in Brian Mawhinney's, so the opening
ceremony should be interesting!<p>
<LI>	Meanwhile in Anglesley it's <strong>Euroroute alert!</strong> People are being
asked to camp from 17th March in a show of strength at the beginning of a
public enquiry which will decide the fate of all the usual SSSIs, wetlands,
woodlands and sacred sites - again with our new friend the DBFO. Phone 01248
713604.<p>
<LI>	Fancy some 'Night of the Living Tonques'? Film, cinema and music at The
Junction, Clifton Road, <strong>Cambridge</strong>, for &#163;2.50. Box office
01223 511511.<p>
<LI>	Scientists in Palmer Station, Antartica, have found that some plants and
molluscs are beginning to produce their very own <strong>sunscreens</strong>.
The Antartic Pearl Wort develops a pigment to protect itself against UV
assault, while some molluscs in the region produce UV absorbing amino acids
which act in the same way as a good dose of factor 25.<p>
<LI>	It's not often that we give royalty the thumbs up here at SchNEWS, but this
week we'd like to extend a hearty Nice One to <strong>King Hussain of
Jordan</strong>. The regal one has decreed one of his palaces to orphaned and
homeless children, after losing sleep following a visit to the al Hussain
Social Welfare Foundation. The actions of the philanthropic King have led to
calls for similar gestures by other royal figures. Hussain is known to be a
close chum of our own dear Queenie...Perhaps Liz can do something decent for
once and offer Buck House over for the same, instead of setting up a poncy
website.

<A NAME="eatmeat">Doctors say McDonalds Lied in Kids Promotion</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>In the wake of this week's shock news that the government
covered up the state of Britain's abbatoirs, and the fact that they're riddled
with <EM>e.coli</EM>, comes the latest from the twisted world of that mad old clown
Ronald McDonald. McD's has produced a slick promotional campaign in the U.S.
which says that kids can &quot;climb higher and ride their bikes farther&quot;
if they eat foods from the &quot;meat group&quot;.<p>
However, the concept that meat improves endurance was abandoned more than 100
years ago. A spokesperson for the Physicians Committee on Responsible Medicine
said that the statement was like <EM>&quot;telling them they can get more homework
done by watching TV.&quot;</EM><p>
Also in the States, McD's are launching a new scheme called <EM>Campaign 55</EM>, which
is basically a major price war on their rivals Burger King and Wendy's. After
the news broke, shares in many major fast-food chains were sent tumbling. Last
year McD's saw its sales drop by 3.3%...Only another 96.7% to go...

<A NAME="finally">...and finally...</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Jack Straw, the man with the mission of making Michael Howard
look like a cuddly softy, has had some new ideas. This time he wants to be seen
to be tougher than Michael Howard against the latest - as seen on East Enders -
scourge on society, 10-13 year olds. Jack's worried that <em>&quot;at present
we have a medieval law which assumes that youngsters 10-13 are 'incapable of
evil' unless the prosecution can prove the reverse.&quot;</em> Jack doesn't
like medieval laws - right to silence, not allowing the state to break into
your house, that sort of thing - because medieval laws are too enlightened and
left-wing for New Labour. Instead he wants to build more children's prisons
(&quot;streamline arrangements for secure accommodation&quot;) and put younger
kids into them.<p>
SchNEWS phoned New Labour to clarify these new proposals. If 10 year olds are
assumed to know good from evil and can be tried in court by juries, then surely
10 year olds should be able to serve on juries? So do Labour plan to reduce the
age you can serve on juries from 18 to 10 in line with the age juries can try
people at? <em>&quot;We-have-no-such-proposals-at-present&quot;</em> repeats
the press office Dalek. Silly old us for imagining New Labour might be
consistent on this one - after all, the right to be tried by your peers is one
of those boring old medieval rights that New Labour is so keen to update,
modernise and get rid of. Expect much, much more from May 1st. Laptops! Laptops!
