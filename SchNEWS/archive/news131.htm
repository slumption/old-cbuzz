<h2><A NAME="oil">OIL BE DAMNED!</A></h2> 
<em>"Climate change is the biggest threat facing the planet"</em><br> 
<strong>- Greenpeace</strong> 
<p>Last Monday, oil giants British Petroleum flexed their corporate muscles but shot themselves in the foot 
when they took Greenpeace to court to freeze their assets.  BP are fed up with the environmentalists 
continuing disruption of the oil industry in the North Atlantic but the legal action has simply helped boost 
the publicity for the campaign against climate change. 
<p>BP also want to sue four members of Greenpeace's UK operation for &#163;1.4 million (the amount BP 
spend every year on supporting environmental projects), and got a court injunction ordering the 
organisation not to interfere with the company's activities in the Foinaven field.  
<p>However, as SchNEWS went to press the company had already seriously retreated - despite getting no 
concessions from Greenpeace to be good boys and girls. Control Risks, an organisation which advises 
multinationals on coping with protest, clearly understood this: <em>"If BP had persisted with legal 
action, it could have provided  Greenpeace with the opportunity to portray itself once more as the 
underdog standing proud against big business."</em> 
<p>The Atlantic Frontier is perhaps Northern Europe's last pristine wilderness - with the same bio-
diversity as a temperate forest. However, this could all change if the area is industrialised. The Foinhaven 
itself is not an oil rig but the largest floating vessel in the world which will be able to refine the oil on 
board.  Instead of using pipelines, ships will ferry the oil back and forth. Spills and accidents are 
inevitable - waves can reach 40 metres. Worse, if the operation is successful, then the oil companies will, 
for the first time, be able to exploit the rest of the world's deepest oceans. 
<p>In June, Greenpeace occupied Rockall - a small outpost in the Atlantic - as a publicity stunt, 
establishing a new country called Waveland. This became the springboard for further actions. Seismic 
ships were targeted first . These ships have sensor guns that stretch for a mile, shooting high pitched 
sounds along the seabed to check for oil. Activists have been sitting on the guns, taking ship satellite 
equipment apart and getting in the way of the vessels, which have to travel in straight lines in order for 
the tests to be accurate. Any diversion and they have to start all over again! Last week people D-locked 
themselves to the Stena Dee oil platform, before a survival capsule was hoisted up the rig, housing 
activists 40 feet above sea level. As Al Baker, who spent time on Rockall put it <em>"We've already got 
enough oil around the world in reserves and oil fields to destroy the climate within the next 40 years. We 
don't need to mine anymore."</em> However, enough was apparently enough for BP. 
<p><em>"It's fine to campaign against whalers, even to make symbolic occupations of lonely rocks, but to 
try - and to succeed, if only for a few days - to slow the progress of a platform reaching BP's &#163;1 billion 
Foinhaven field in the North Atlantic is one action too far."</em><br> 
<strong>- John Vidal</strong> 
<p> Greenpeace is also taking the Department of Trade and Industry to the High Court over the lack of 
environmental directives applied in the Atlantic Frontier oilfields. Twenty-two oil companies have thrown 
their weight behind the DTi. If the judge rules that the court case can go ahead  production could possibly 
be halted while the case is being heard.  
<p><em>"BP's principal concern is not the recovery of damages. Rather it is to ensure its lawful 
operations are not interfered with and safety is not compromised. BP has never questioned Greenpeace's 
right to campaign on climate change issues, but we do object to their employing unlawful 
tactics."</em><br> 
<strong>- BP Press Release</strong> 
<p>...translated means 'you can have ineffective demos but don't do anything that works.' 
<p>But Greenpeace aren't about to play ball. The stakes are already too high. 
<p>According to over 300 climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we can 
only burn a quarter of known fossil reserves before climate change becomes intolerable, if not 
catastrophic. To avoid this, the fossil fuel industries must be phased out. Even if all emissions ended 
tomorrow, it could be years before global warming was stopped, let alone reversed.  
<h3>Oil Pressure Rising</h3> 
From Saturday "100 DAYS OF ACTION" kicks off.  That's 100 days to the run-up to the Kyoto climate 
summit, and people are being invited to organise direct action against the oil industry. Organisations as 
diverse as Reclaim The Streets, Friends of the Earth and TAPOL (Indonesian human rights organisation) 
are involved. Greg from Corporate Watch told SchNEWS <em>"Fighting the oil industry isn't new. 
Decent folk the world over have had enough of its devastating environmental impact and its involvement 
in human rights abuses. But while the industry's public relations machine paints cases such as Shell in 
Nigeria as one-off lapses of good practice, the lesson people are learning is that they must now challenge 
the industry as a whole; that its abuses are inherent to its nature, and that people can, indeed must, learn 
to live without it."</em>

<li>Planning meetings will be held at intervals every two weeks, and a newsletter is being put 
together. 
<li>Call Jim on 0171 865 8234, or e-mail

or write to 100 days, c/o Corporate Watch, Box E, 111 Magdalen Road, Oxford OX4 1RQ 01865 791391 
<li>Conveniently, the hundred days includes Shell's 100th Birthday (18th October). 
</ul> 
<h3>No More Mr Nice Guys</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Colombia</strong> - People who have taken direct action against environmental damage caused by BP 
have been identified and murdered by paramilitaries. BP are implicated in passing on information on local 
activists by videoing community meetings.  
<li><strong>Alaska</strong> -  serious environmental damage by developing the north slope, now lobbying to open up
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of America's last pristine wilderness. Held partially responsible 
for Exxon Valdez spill.  
<li><strong>England</strong> - In 1992 the BP Chemicals plant in Hull was found to be discharging twice the amount 
of Methyl Ethyl Ketone into the water as the total amount released in US. This chemical causes birth 
defects.

<li>A campaign has been set up to stop companies drilling for oil and gas less than five miles off the 
Pembrokeshire coast. The area is home to marine animals such as grey seals, dolphins, harbour porpoises, 
gannets, shearwaters and razorbills and even the extremely rare pygmy sperm whales. To find out more

<h2><A NAME="harmer">Badboy Harmer</A></h2>
Not content with trying to destroy one Special Site of Scientific Interest earlier this year (see <a href="news117.htm#farmer">SchNEWS 
117</a>) Farmer Harmer is at it again! This time he wants to plough up the Offham marshland SSSI to plant 
flax in order to take advantage of another mad Common Agricultural Policy  scam. Packed full of newts, 
frogs, dragonflies, water scorpions and kingfishers, the site backs onto the river Ouse outside Lewes. One 
local resident told SchNEWS "SSSI's represent the small pockets left of biodiversity in an otherwise 
ecological barren Britain." Last Sunday activists set up camp on his land last Sunday and people are 
needed now. Come a take a restful break in a beautiful part of the South Downs - but bring sunblock. A 
continuous presence  is needed, as the trustworthy farmer trashed a bender at the entrance to the field 
when no-one was looking.   
<p>Directions - Take the A275 out of Lewes (at the corner  of the prison) towards Plumpton. Go to 
Offham village, park opposite the church behind the Old PostHouse. Take the path into woods for 5 
minutes and camp is in a field over a gate on the left. Better still, take train to Lewes, walk thru the town 
to the river  Ouse on the western bank and walk north for 20 minutes. It's under the railway line where the 
pumping station lives.

On September 30th <STRONG>Mordechai Vanunu</STRONG> will have spent 11
years in an Israeli prison, all of it in solitary confinement.  After
blowing the whistle on Israel's secret nuclear capacity in the British
press, he was lured to Rome by a Mossad agent, kidnapped, taken to
Israel and sentenced to 18 years for treason and espionage.  Years
locked up alone without daylight in a cell two metres by three is
beginning to affect Mordechai's mental health, which is reported to be
deteriorating.  CND's Non-violent Resistance Network is co-ordinating
events for the 11th anniversary of Mordechai's imprisonment - ring

Del Monte like to say yes - but only to profits. However, they had a bit of a surprise last Wednesday when 
one and a half tonnes of bananas were dutifully dumped outside their offices in Tunbridge Wells, from 
people who like to say No. The action, organised by the World Development Movement, was in response 
to Del Monte's plans to ban its plantation workers from being in a union. Their offices were shut down for 
most of the day and the company are now reconsidering their position.
