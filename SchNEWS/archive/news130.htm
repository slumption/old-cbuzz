<A NAME="Heading1">TRIAL AND ERROR</A></h2>

<p> "<EM>So, what I'm charged with in plain English is that "Somewhere
in the world over a five year period (they're not sure when) I
conspired with people (most of whom I don't know) to incite other
people (they don't know who) to commit criminal damage (they don't
know what) and that the conspiracy continued into the day after we
were charged..."</EM><br> - <STRONG>Robin Webb, Animal Liberation
Front (ALF)</STRONG><p>


 Some Orwellian nightmare? Well no, this is what six people were charged
with when on 16th January 1996, when 30 + cops were acting for ARNI
(the Animal Rights National Index ) did dawn raids and arrested four
editors of Green Anarchist (GA) newspaper, the ALF Supporters Group
Newsletter's editor and Robin Webb, the ALF press officer. Robin Webb
has since had charges dropped on a technicality, but still continues
to be harassed. This was the culmination of Operation Washington
which, according to police, has been running since 1991 and which saw
55 raids across the UK throughout the course of 1995/6.<p>


"<EM>We're accused of inciting an arson wave by the Animal Rights
Militia on the Isle of Wight in 1994. We didn't write a damn thing
about the Isle of Wight until after the event</EM>..."<br> <STRONG>-
Green Anarchist editorial</STRONG><p>

The arrestees were all charged with `conspiracy to incite criminal
damage' - for reporting direct action news or knowing others that had. This
`crime' could land each of the defendants in prison for up to 5 years.
According to StateWatch "<EM>Britain has the most repressive conspiracy laws in
Europe.</EM>" For the so-called `Thought Police' to prove their case, no
criminal damage need be done nor anyone feel incited to do it: the
`conspirators' need know no-one doing damage and may know each other only
tenuously or indirectly (in this case, having attended the same political rally
- along with thousands of other concerned people); it's all down to their
<EM>intent   </EM>and  in practice what that means is the defendants have to
prove a negative in court, that they didn't intend anything. As you can imagine
many believe the conspiracy/incitement laws to be a bit of a `catch all', with
its heavy penalties making it a useful tool in suppressing direct action after
the failure of the Criminal Justice Act.<p>
   In a similar case in 1988 two editors of the ALF support group were jailed
in  for 18 months in a similar case for reporting acts against animal abuse.<p>
According to the committal even just reporting the <STRONG>facts </STRONG>about animal
lib or eco-defence actions constitutes incitement. Let alone printing opinions
in favour of these. Under this, we are up against a very broad, sweeping
definition and the implications of this are going to be used as a catch-all
against the entire radical press... Therefore  this is not just a problem for
Green Anarchist alone, it is everybody's problem, because it concerns freedom
of speech. There is no evidence at all suggesting that any of the defendants
were involved in the acts reported, but the prosecution is trying to say that
people would have been encouraged by the favourable reporting of them. Why is
reporting events that have already happened incitement? Some of the news had
already been reported in the national press- are they going to find themselves
in the dock as well? However, one editor of GA told SchNEWS, "<EM>What's more
likely to encourage people to act is the continuing abuse against animals and
the planet</EM>"  <p>
There have also been over 100 raids connected with the case; an old lady who
wrote to Robin Webb in prison had her door knocked down, and a man who bought a
GA T-shirt was also raided.<p>
This case has also involved the use of  Public Interest Immunity orders, or, as
it should be more properly called `Police Interest Impunity' - PII's are being
used to suppress evidence of secret state action against Green Anarchist
magazine. There has been interest from the security services, as was admitted
by DI Des Thomas during the committal proceedings in December 1996, and this is
being used as an excuse not to disclose documents that could be vital to the
defence. The Gandalf 6 believe that they were infiltrated by an agent
provocateur who encouraged them to write the articles accused of being
inciting.  The prosecution are not obliged to disclose their evidence so as not
to compromise any agent's future activities, PII's are serving as police
protection. All accounts suggest that the trial is going to be shrouded in
mystery, with everybody, including the defence and defendants, being barred
from the court room on the first day of the trial whilst the judge and defence
decide what evidence to submit and what must be withheld.<p>
   Their trial begins at Portsmouth Crown Court on August 26th, and a bike
blockade  of Portsmouth is being planned for 9am that morning. Hampshire
Police, predictably, unhappy about the whole thing - appear to be panicking!
They have been removing posters almost as soon as they go up, and are
attempting to prosecute someone for contempt of Court for giving out 20,000
leaflets advertising  the trial  ! - contact Green Anarchist  BM 1715, London
WC1N 3XX for more details .<p>
There will be transport going from Brighton for the first day of the trial.

<A NAME="Heading2">Crap Arrests of the Week</A></h2>

<p>
With the only offence for occupying a building being "civil trespass", an
unarrestable matter for the courts not the police to deal with, police have
been snatching at any opportunity they can find to arrest and remove protesters
from buildings.  Two office occupations this week have witnessed extremely crap
arrests: <p>
<UL>
<LI>	For being a journalist, one person was searched whilst occupying the Rank
offices and was found to be holding an NUJ (National Union of Journalists)
card. When he couldn't remember his pin number he was  nicked.<p>
<LI>	For possession of two (totally legal) hemp seeds the man was arrested and
received a body cavity search.<p>
<LI>	A Reclaim The Streets party-goer was arrested for assaulting a police officer
- by viciously sprinkling mineral water on him.<p>
</UL>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">Toxic Tip</A></h2>

<p>

Newlands Park Estate near Wakefield is a 200 acre historic site
containing Roman remains, a grade 2 listed building , and an important
wildlife habitat, but it is now the proposed site of the largest toxic
dump in Europe.<p>

The Warmfield company (owned by Mr Horrocks, a Freemason and close
friend of Thatcher) applied for permission to dump toxic waste seven
years ago. Locals formed Residents Against Toxic Scheme (R.A.T.S.),
and on May 18th, 3000 people staged a mass trespass.<p>

Paul Dainton of RATS told SchNEWS "the site will contain industrial,
domestic and commercial waste. This could mean anything from
industrial paints to animal carcasses, fish waste, and low-level
radioactive materials, such as old hospital equipment." Paul was
served with an injunction prohibiting him from all land owned by
Warmfield, after it accused him of inciting trouble.<p>

The new proposal is to cover the site in 4.1 million cubic metres of
toxic waste, destroying the habitat of newts, skylarks, and badgers,
as well as woodland, and fishing ponds. There are other problems
expected throughout its 25 year working life, and afterwards;<p>
<p>

<UL> <LI> <EM>Traffic</EM> - 2000 tons of waste a day will be
delivered to the site, which could involve 300 vehicles per hour <p>

<LI> <EM>Health Hazards </EM>- with 2000 tons of toxic waste being
tipped every day, dust and debris will affect a large area <p>

<LI> <EM>Water Pollution</EM> - 75 cubic metres of liquid waste will
leak from the site every day, and contaminate the water table <p>

<LI> <EM>Landfill Gas</EM> - 2700 cubic metres of explosive gas will
be produced.<p>
</UL>

<STRONG>STOP PRESS</STRONG> At the latest enquiry on 12th August, 1000 people brought
traffic to a standstill outside Wakefield town hall for 2 hours. The inspector,
couldn't understand the case , and adjourned it!  R.A.T.S. need your support!
Ring them on 01924 893564 and write to the Appeal inspector c/o Wakefield Town
Hall, Wood Street, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, with your objections

<A NAME="Heading4">New Slave Labour</A></h2>

<p>
Despite Labour's promise of abolishing workfare, twenty new pilot areas have
just introduced the work-for-your-dole plus-a-tenner slave labour scheme.<p>
In Brighton the two `providers' (the people who find you crap jobs) - Training
Network (TN) and AVS - have not had an easy ride. On Monday TN faced an angry
classroom of naughty claimants swelled in size by `outside agitators' who would
have shown-up the girls from St.Trinians! <p>
Now attention is being turned on the few charities that are taking on
placements. In Brighton this includes Tarnerland, Brighthelm Centre, Hove YMCA
and Northbrook College. One claimant told SchNEWS "If people want to work for
voluntary groups that's fair enough, but people are being forced into doing
menial jobs under the pretence of training - with threats of losing all
benefits if they refuse." Oxfam, Mind,  Help the Aged and Brighton Council all
oppose the scheme. <p>

<UL>

<LI> There will be a picket this coming Monday (18th) 8.45 AM
<STRONG>SHARP</STRONG> outside Tower Point, North Rd (opposite the
Post Office sorting office) to let claimants know their rights.If you
find yourself on this scheme remember: The providers are desperate -
they cannot find enough vacancies for people. <STRONG>THIS IS A WINNABLE
CAMPAIGN IF PEOPLE STICK TOGETHER.</STRONG>

5.30 pm Brighton Unemployed Centre, 6 Tilbury Place. <p>

<LI> Scotland had its first Reclaim the Streets last week on the 1st
day of the Edinburgh Festival. A joint event with theatre group
RoadRage, 200 people had an impromtu Ceilidh for a few hours, before
the Police - taken completely by surprise - nicked 22 people. As usual
if you witnessed any arrests, give us a ring and we will pass on
details <p>

<LI> 30 people occupied Rank's offices in Central London on Wednesday,
attempting to persuade them to reconsider their plans to build an
Oasis holiday village in Lyminge Forest, Kent. Activists barricaded
themselves into rooms, rearranged files and keys, dropped banners from
the roof tops and quizzed bemused office staff. After a few hours the
TSG arrived and removed protesters from the building. Inside
information suggests that Rank are still unsure as to whether they
will go ahead with the [sterling]100 million scheme, so keep the
pressure up on Rank. Oh, and special thanks to Sir Denys Henderson for
the use of the shower! <p>

<LI> A man walking his dog in a Hastings park had a plastic bag
snatched from his hand by a young thief on a bicycle. The police
however declined to investigate - as the bag contained only dogs
excrement collected by the thoughtful owner <p>

<LI> A Greenpeace occupation of BP's Stena Dee oil platform, 70 miles
west of Shetland, began last Saturday with seven activists D-locking
themselves to the platform. A survival capsule has now been hoisted up
the rig, and is housing the activists 40ft above sea level <p> <LI>
Activists gathered in Brussels on the 52nd anniversary of the bombing
of Hiroshima, and put into action the International Court of Justice
ruling that nuclear weapons are illegal by shutting down the main
entrance of the NATO headquarters. Four `war crimes inspectors' who
cut their way into the base were given half an hour to put their point
across to the head of the Secretary Generals' private office. On the
anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki 3 days later activists
`visited' nuclear sites across Europe and entered bases to inspect for
further illegal activities. Over 50 activists gathered at Aldermaston
(where the UK assemble the trident warheads) and spent a fun afternoon
learning how to climb over a variety of fences. Two people were
arrested for `suspicion of criminal damage to a CCTV camera'.<p>

 <LI>
The campaign against the proposed 300 million pound M11 Link Road in
east London continued last Wednesday with a spectacular raft action
carried out by Reclaim The Streets and the London Cycling
Campaign. Contractors are trying to construct a bridge over the River
Lee.  The road will bring around 75 000 motor vehicles a day into
inner London. Contact RTS 0171 281 4621.<p>

<A NAME="Heading6">Rainbow Keepers</A></h2>

<p>
   On July 16 Rainbow Keepers set up a protest camp against Rostov nuclear
power plant in the south of Russia, and organised information pickets
in nearby Volgodonsk. A week later activists blocked the road to the
power plant with people chained to a barricade of concrete filled
barrels. <p>
  For a few days local administration and police tried to break the barricade
with a car, then about 500 workers, lead by the union bosses and
administration, finally attacked the barricade and burned down the
camp. As a result of violently breaking the concrete/human chain all
of the protesters were injured and beaten, five of them were taken to
hospital with head injuries, broken noses and damaged spines. All the
tents in the camp were burned, cameras smashed and films exposed, many
of the protesters lost their documents and personal
possessions. Police, who were there, didn't move to prevent the attack
and their chief later declared he was proud of this operation.<p>

<A NAME="Heading7">42 Nights on the Tiles</A></h2>

<p>
   On June 19 1997 at 6.15 am six people scaled the walls of the Liverpool
Irish Centre and began a roof top protest against the closure of the
centre by the receivers.  In October 1994 the local Irish community
formed a co-op to save the Irish centre after the businessman who had
previously owned the centre went bankrupt. In order to raise the
finance the co-op borrowed [sterling]330.000,- from Scottish Newcastle
Brewery (who own McEwans Lager ) .
<p>
Throughout this period the centre was continually harassed by our dear
friends in Merseyside Police. A St Patrick's day march in 1996 of over
1000 people was stopped by mounted riot Police, because 30 fascists
had blocked the route. On March 21st the Centre was raided by 20
uniformed and 6 plain clothes police, while a Woodcraft Folk Meeting
(sort of green version of the Scouts) was happening.  Only 6 days
later, the Centre was surrounded by armed Police and a helicopter (who
"happened to be passing"), because they had apparently received a
report of a break-in, and threatened to shoot someone on the roof who
was checking the light space!<p>
   In April 1997 Scottish Newcastle broke an agreement on repayments and sent
in the receivers, who also broke their promise to keep the centre open
and on June 18 closed the doors of the centre on the community. The
following day the roof top protest began, and they have been there for
6 weeks, relying on support from well-wishers and passers-by.<p>
Support is urgently needed, and they are calling for a boycott of
McEwans lager. You can ring Scottish Courage on 0131 556 2591 and tell
them what you think of their beer.<p>

First it was Michael Howard's garden. As people invaded the grounds, goats
happily munched away at any vegetation they could get their choppers round in
protest against the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act. Then the old
roads minister Steven Norris got the goat as the stage was invaded by more four
legged beasts, as he opened the Wells `relief' road. Last week goats  were
unleashed on an unsuspecting Employment Service Manager in Bolton:<p>
