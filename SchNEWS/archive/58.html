<font size=  +1 >&quot;With hundreds of security and police this is the largest mobilisation of state forces yet against the anti-roads movement.  If you can only get to Newbury once - do it.  It's not only your chance to stop this insane road being built  but also to show your defiance of the Criminal Justice Act.&quot;</font>




<P>
Week three of the Third Battle of Newbury and the imaginative 
tactics used by the protesters are really worrying 
the roadbuilders, the government and the police - because 
they are effectively getting more and more people off 
their arses and into direct action.  <p>
Protesters are continually rethinking their tactics 
in the face of more and more desperate attempts to 
ensure the site is cleared before the nesting season 
in March. Around one sixth of the route has now been 
cleared and the security cordons protecting the chainsaw 
gangs are now larger than football pitches. The police 
are not even giving warnings before nicking people 
for Aggravated Trespass  (you can be nicked for this 
if a copper just <I>thinks </I>that you are going to disrupt 
a 'lawful activity' on private land). They then dish 
out bail conditions which amount to a sentence without 
trial and virtual house arrest. Protesters guilty of 
no offence are being told not to go anywhere near the 
protests and some are having to sign on at police stations 
in their home towns every day to stop them demonstrating. 
One solicitor told <b>SchNEWS</b>, &quot;Bail conditions are 
not meant to be punishments in themselves. In this 
case they are clearly being used as a political means 
to suppress campaigns.&quot;  Bindmans solicitors are 
currently preparing cases to take to the High Court 
to get these conditions overturned. As one protester 
told <b>SchNEWS</b>, &quot;The police are using these bail 
conditions to try and break the protest. We've got 
to make them unworkable by breaking them&quot;. <BR>
There are now 20 camps along the eight and half mile 
route and more people are needed now to help build 
defences. One way protesters are making sure the road 
won't be built is by fortifying and defneding these 
camps. Four of them are in the High Court today (Friday) 
faced with eviction notices.  <p>
Every morning a convoy of roadbuilders and security 
flanked by masses of police  around three quarters 
of a mile long converges to the south of Newbury - 
protesters have successfully slowed up proceedings 
by  driving 10 miles an hour in front of them! The 
media's big story this week was about the guy who was 
meant to have cut one of the security vans' brakecables 
- failing to mention after successfully blockading 
their coach he was dragged off by security and held 
onto some wires which snapped. The police later arrested 
the wrong man for this 'offence'.<p>
Protestors have occupied land, blockaded contractors 
and security transport, D-locked themselves to anything 
going and generally put every obstacle in the way of 
the clearance work. Against this, the police are doing 
what they've always done - use the law, including their 
new powers under the CJA, to stop any effective protest. 
 So it's pretty worrying when Friends of the Earth 
- on behalf of the Newbury protesters - put out press 
releases condemning &quot;deliberate damage&quot; by 
protesters and calling for protesters to have a &quot;positive 
relationship&quot; with the police who are arresting 
them!  When <b>SchNEWS</b> phoned Friends of the Earth to 
clarify their views they told us that &quot;We don't 
condemn the police - it's unfortunate that they have 
to take these draconian actions but they do have a 
job to do&quot;. Friends of the Earth are doing loads 
of useful work to support the campaign but we should 
recognise that the police's job is to do what the government 
tells them, in this case ensure the Newbury bypass 
is built - and that it's kind of difficult to have 
a &quot;positive relationship&quot; with people who 
are arresting you for just about anything.<p><B>
Only illegal, in-your-face direct action will stop this 
road - and everybody knows it. With spiralling costs 
some of the construction firms are getting cold feet 
and the police are saying publicly they cannot afford 
to continue to police the protest. In other words this 
battle can be won - if people get down to Newbury and 
stop this road! As one activist told SchNEWS, &quot;We 
need people who are prepared to get up very early and 
take the battle to the contractors before they get 
near the site. We need people who are organised and 
are willing to get arrested to stop this madness. We 
need hundreds of them and we need them now.&quot; <p>
<center><font size=  +2 >KNOW YOUR RIGHTS</font></center></B><p>
If you refuse bail conditions you could also find yourself 
in jail (one person is already inside on remand for 
a week for refusing bail)  If you are nicked remember 
don't give em  your date of birth and a care-of address 
(could come in handy if the benefits crack-down on 
protestors begins) but make sure people in the house 
know you are doing this in case the police check - 
and make sure its your home town or  you could end 
up signing on daily in the Shetland Isles!       Remember 
- Fight all cases, plead not guilty and clog up the 
courts.<P><center><b>DID YOU KNOW? </b></center><p>
* During the GLC's fairs fare policy in the early eighties there was an immediate 13% decrease in cars going into London.<br>  
* In Manchester the new tram system (with a service every six minutes) has proved to be a winner. A survey has shown a 10 per cent reduction in traffic at peak times along its route.<br>
*  Karosruhe, Germany . A new tram system has led to a 40% switch from cars to trams!<br>
* Even in Los Angeles where sixteen lane motorways still didn't stop the traffic jams - trams and railways are now making a comeback as planners realise more roads = more cars. <br>

The witchhunt against the Exodus collective continues. 
 With Biggs still on a trumped up murder charge and 
High Court Injunctions are being dished out like confetti 
the party people from Luton are under serious attack. 
<p>
Last Tuesday another victory has been won against the 
powers that be.   Glenn Jenkins, spokesperson for the 
Exodus Collective was cleared of breaching an injunction 
forbidding him from &quot;holding, causing to hold, 
or permitting the holding of any organised entertainment 
to which the public have access&quot;.  The courts 
were unable to prove that he had any part in organising 
the rave.   However victory was short-lived when  Glenn, 
and three named others, have had another injunction 
taken out against them by Luton Borough Council.  The 
notice has only been served against Glenn, who is due 
in court today.  They have banned him from attending 
any unlicensed parties in Luton, South and Mid Beds, 
and are now trying to scapegoat him by making him responsible 
for the operations of the rest of the crew.  If any 
other members of the Collective choose to hold another 
party, Glenn could be imprisoned.  The injunction also 
stops him speaking in an official capacity regarding 
unlicensed parties.  These measures are an infringement 
of his civil liberties, his freedom of movement, speech 
and right to free association.  The injunction is in 
excess of the Council' s power as they are criminalising 
activities that even Parliament has has not (yet) criminalised. 
 And all this despite the fact that they have been 
trying, since 1992, to seek a resolution to this problem 
by finding a venue for a community centre and putting 
on do's each month to finance it.  Unlike commercial 
promoters, money raised from the parties is channelled 
back into the community- rehousing forty people at 
HAZ Manor, a former old people's home, building up 
the stack and helping people create something out of 
nothing.<p>
Glenn's liberty is seriously at stake here.  He is being 
held responsible for the activities of the rest of 
the Collective members.  Exodus is a positively non-hierarchical 
organisation- something the authorities don't seem 
to be able to get their heads around.  There is no 
ringleader, no single organiser.  The parties are a 
collective effort between everyone who wants to be 
involved.  Exodus- Movement of Jah People.  Full power 
to ya!<p>
* Black Moon sound system, the first crew to be charged 
under the rave sections of the CJA, have a new court 
date.  They are being charged for preparing to play 
at the Mother festy- the one that wasn't!  After numerous 
adjournments, they are now in Corby magistrates at 
10am on Tuesday 27th February.  Turn up and give them 
some support!<P>

From 1st March, CS Gas will be tested by sixteen police forces in the UK.  This gas is a highly toxic chemical warfare gas that can cause spasms, severe injuries and death. Symptoms caused by the gas include severe stinging to the eyes, nose and throat, skin blistering, severe sneezing and coughing and chest tightening that leads to impaired breathing. The effects last up to an hour.<p>
The six month trials should have started last September, but were postponed when a police training officer suffered burns and eye injuries.  Critics - including the injured officer (changed your tune, eh mate?), Amnesty International and Liberty - are especially concerned about the effects of the gas on pregnant women,  bronchial sufferers and asthmatics - one in seven children in Britain now have asthma. The gas has been condemned as &quot;indiscrimate&quot; by a leading expert on the effects of chemical weapons and Amnesty International has said that it is particularly worried about its use in heavily populated areas.<p>
The introduction of CS Gas, coming hard on the heels of last year's introduction of the side handled baton, marks a further stage in the militarisation of the police. The police say they need the gas to protect themselves against the increase in violent attacks on them - but already one Chief Constable, the head of Gwent police, has refused to rule out using CS Gas against anti-roads protesters. Supposedly, the spray will only be used when the police &quot;believe themselves to be in danger of assault&quot; - but civil rights campaigners fear the police may use it to quell demonstrations, protests and stop free parties and festivals. Given the police's indiscriminate use of their powers of arrest in such situations - a cursory glance through 'crap arrests of the week' will give you the idea - it will only be a matter of time before they start using this vicious weapon against party-goers and protesters they take a dislike to.<p>
What next, we hear you cry?  Why not the incapacitative foam used by UN forces in Somalia last year. The foam contains bubbles of CS gas and can be laid as a barrier to block a road or contain a hostile crowd. Perfect for those dirty, uncouth, scroungy Newbury types - you know, the security and the coppers

The Selar Farm open-cast mine protesters at Neath Valley near Cwmgwrach, South Wales, are expecting to be evicted on Monday 29 January.  Bailiffs have been seen buying equipment in the area, and it seems one of them let it slip to a local shopkeeper (ooh er, missus!).  Get down to the site and support them if you can.  Call Norma on 01639 720884 for directions, or Cardiff Action Update on 01222 383363.

Can you spare some humanity please Sgt O'Donnell? Probably not. <p>****The next Brighton Legal Defence and Monitoring Group meeting will be next Thursday 1st February at Brighton Unemployed Centre.
