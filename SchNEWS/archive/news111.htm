<H2><A NAME="injunctions">UP THE INJUNCTION!</A></H2>

Let's play a game. Imagine you are standing on a public footpath monitoring the
activities of a waste company that's killing a protected species. The company
isn't happy with your presence and get a court order banning you from `spying'
on them. You visit the proposed route of the Newbury Bypass and are arrested.
<STRONG><EM>Go directly to jail.</EM></STRONG> You're a long term peace protester who decides to
break an injunction telling you not to enter an RAF base. <STRONG><EM>Go directly to
jail.</EM></STRONG><p>
  In the never-ending quest to silence public protest, big business and
government are using court injunctions to gag those who want to blow the
whistle. Bans are a way for the rich and powerful to keep the polluters
polluting, the loggers logging, and the toxic landfillers filling our world
with hazardous waste.<p>
  In America, it's known as being SLAPPed - <EM>Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
Participation</EM>. Professor Penelope Canan from the University of Colorado
describes them as, &quot;A new and very disturbing trend with grave consequences for
politically active citizens and for our political system.&quot; The injunction is
designed to silence people through legal intimidation, but hardly ever actually
comes to court.<p>
  People have been SLAPPed for attending meetings, for signing petitions,
reporting pollution violations, writing to newpaper editors, testifying at
public hearings and even taking part in boycotts. <p>
  Irene Mansfield was SLAPPed for <STRONG>$5,000,000</STRONG> in 1986 for opposing a
hazardous waste landfill in Texas and calling it a `dump'. Mansfield's husband
was also named in the suit, for failing to `control his wife', even though he
had not protested against the landfill! In 1990, the Pacific Lumber Company
sued an American Earth First!er for $25,000 for sitting in a Redwood tree.<p>
  Like all good American ideas, it's McSpreading... In Britain, court
injunctions were supposed to protect people against harassment from named
individuals (such as violent ex-partners) but, funnily enough, they are
increasingly being use  to try to deal with naughty protesters who just won't
go away.<p>
First they came for the <STRONG>Travellers</STRONG>.<p>
  In 1985, after years of free festies at Stonehenge, the authorities had
enough, and decided to stop them happening. One problem: the gatherings were
not breaking any law. Wiltshire police and the local Council came up with a
civil injunction to prevent travellers from going to Stonehenge and used it as
justification for arresting <EM>everyone</EM> at the Battle of the Beanfield.<p>
  Then they came for the <STRONG>Road Protesters</STRONG>.<p>
  At Twyford Down, the state began getting rather angry with hundreds of people
constantly running round on site. So long as no-one caused any damage, then no
laws were being broken. 76 people were put on a High Court injunction by the
Dept of Transport (DoT), preventing them from entering the construction site or
interfering with work. Disregard of these conditions meant the risk of a six
month jail sentence for contempt of court. Undeterred, people continued to
protest and at least 8 people were eventually sent down. The DoT then tried to
sue the 76 for &#163;3.2m in costs arising from the security and policing -
so not only did you get dragged around and beaten up,
you now had to pay for the privilege! Many people with homes or jobs were
facing financial ruin, but luckily, the case was so badly organised, it
eventually collapsed, with a few defendants having to pay a nominal
&#163;500 in costs.<p>
  Then the <STRONG>CriminaI Justice Act</STRONG> came for us all.<p>
  This bigoted piece of legislation has made illegal just about any protest
that is vaguely effective. But even the CJA cannot stop the demonstrations, so
it's back to injunctions...<p>
  Klaus Armstrong-Braun, a Green Party Councillor on Flintshire County Council,
has been ordered by a court to stop `spying' on a waste company. The company,
AD Waste, is wholly owned by the council of which he is a member and is busy
turning Brookhill Quarry - containing the largest colony of Great Crested Newts
in Wales and used by local people for the past 40 years - into a toxic waste
dump.<p>
  However, before they could dump the waste they had to drain the main pool, a
principal habitat of the newts. Members of the public witnessed amphibians being minced up in the pumping
operation. Using a public footpath to monitor the operation, Klaus went to see
for himself and concluded the company's activities were breaching European law,
their licensing conditions and the negotiated management plan. So he complained
to the police and county council.<p>
  This didn't go down too well with AD Waste who decided to get heavy, accusing
Klaus of trespass, causing a nuisance and interrupting and disrupting their
rather dubious operations. They slapped a court injunction on him claiming
damages for &quot;interruption of their operations&quot; and ordering him not to &quot;annoy,
disturb, spy upon, harass or picket&quot; the company.<p>
  If he loses the case, he also risks losing his home. If the company succeed a
precedent will be set: threatening the rights of us all to monitor and check
the activities of companies degrading our environment.<p>

<LI>Peace campaigners are increasingly coming up against court
injunctions. British Aerospace have so far given 13 people lifetime injunctions
not to interfere with their business in any way - even encouraging people to
protest by handing out leaflets or speaking at a public meeting could land
these 13 in jail. 
<LI>Lindis Percy, long time peace campaigner, has been given 9
months for breaking an injunction restricting her from entering RAF Lakenheath.
Letters of support: Dl Medical Wing, HMP Holloway, Parkhurst Road, London.
<LI><em>SchTOP Press!</em> On Wednesday, Tracey Hart from the Peace Prisoner Support
Group had her <em>home raided</em> by CID and some of her belongings swiped -
including her diary and <EM>mailing list</EM>. She's warning everyone to make sure they
don't have anything lying around which could be &quot;misinterpreted&quot; like the odd pair
of boltcutters... 
<LI>At Newbury, information gathered by Brays Detective Agency
has been used by the DoT and Costain to get High Court injunctions served on 30
protesters, forbidding them from trespassing on the route of the bypass or
`interfering' in work. One man has already been inside for 3 months for
breaking his injunction.

<H2><A NAME="glasgow">Glasgow Protests</A></H2>

On Monday, over 50 people from the Scottish Socialist Alliance and
Save Our Services campaign occupied Glasgow City Council chambers for nineteen
hours. They tried to prevent the City Council from announcing &#163;80
million worth of cuts, 1500 redundancies, closing down of 130 community
projects - and a 22% rise in Council   Tax! George McNeilage of the North
Pollok Community Council said, <EM>&quot;We have as much right as the councillors to
be in this building; they were voted in two years ago in a stand against cuts
and redundancies. Now they have betrayed every citizen of Glasgow and should
resist or resign.&quot;</EM> Embarrassed council leaders told police not to   eject
protesters because they feared smashing the oak doors to the chambers. However
they did eventually meet and announce the cuts but Socialist Labour Councillor
Tommy Sheridan told SchNEWS: <EM>&quot;The protests and actions will continue.&quot;</EM>

Massive police presence at the home of Richard Budge (owner of RJB

Officers in Sussex decided that Valentine's Day  was the ideal time to
raid the home of suspected drug dealers. Sgt. Theresa Atkins found herself
dressed in a bunny costume pretending she was delivering a romantic message
&quot;Inky Pinky poo, it's down to the nick for you.&quot; This more loved-up, fluffy
style police action apparently worked, as the flat door was opened by the
horrified owner only to see a giant rabbit, shortly followed by a number of
police officers. SchNEWS warns all readers to avoid anyone dressed as a mammoth
bunny, just in case they are amorous police ladies. Keep it fluffy.

This week the chairman of the Prison Governors' Association said: <EM>&quot;No
one in their right   mind would seriously consider the introduction of prison
ships and abandoned holiday camps as prison accommodation.&quot;</EM> Well one person
would and no prizes for guessing. Still, once SchNEWS heard that the good
prison ship Lollipop (OK, it's called Resolution) was costing the Prison
Service ten times more than its scrap value (and creating two jobs at a cost of
&#163;4 million) we thought of a money making scheme. So, dear Fraulein
Widdacombe, Justice? have a very old, knackered van that's worth about
&#163;100 scrap. Maybe you'd be interested? We're offering it to you at the
knock down price of &#163;1,000...a bargain, we're sure you'll agree...

Always give your real name when `They' pursue you with big papery
