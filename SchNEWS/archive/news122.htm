<A NAME="car2">DOWN T' CAKEHOLE</A></h2>

<strong>...and up the duff, Denise takes Swampy's record</strong><p>
At 8am this morning six Runway 2 tunnellers will have been underground for
seven days and one hour - beating Swampy's Fairmile record and costing
Manchester Airport &#163;200 a minute. Destined for fame is mother-to-be Denise
with Muppet Dave, Matt and Neville  who have spent more than a week
`downstairs' in Cakehole at the Flywood Camp. Jeni and Blowpipe are holed up in
Paul McCartney's Cavern.
<h3>
<A NAME="swampy">Swampification!</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>But the Swampification of protests is all lifestyles and no
issues. So SchNEWS brings you the facts behind the Britain's first anti-airport
direct action protest. One thousand acres of greenbelt at beautiful Bollin
Valley in Cheshire - double the land destroyed by the Newbury bypass - will be
Tarmac'ed. The development is pointless - Runway 2 would provide a third more
flights, yet one third of all seats from Manchester are empty. It would be used
at first for just five hours a week. Fifty miles away, Liverpool Airport is
idle. The Airport claim 50,000 jobs will be created. Infact it will create
negligable local employment for &#163;200M of gross environmental destruction.
In February Manchester Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated it would be
more like 5,000.<p>
<em>&quot;Three of my grandchildren have got asthma. I used to walk through
here for years with the dogs. It's disgusting.&quot;<br>- </em><strong>Joyce,
local resident</strong><p>
In January the first people took to the trees after 20 years of letter-writing
opposition in nearby Mobberly, Styal and the well-heeled Wilmslow. A 101-day
enquiry was &quot;loaded in favour of the developers from the start&quot;
according to former Beirut hostage and local Terry Waite. New Labour MP Graham
Stringer was simultaneously leader of Manchester City Council and the chairman
of Manchester Aiport plc - the Council owns 55% of the Airport. Funny that. Yet
Stringer has accused the protesters of <em>&quot;coming from </em> <em>the same
political tradition as Mussolini and Pol Pot.&quot; </em><p>
Terry Waite headed a team of independent legal observers but Stringer denied
access to the eviction site. Police vans patrol the four-mile razor wire
exclusion zone in a &#163;6 million security operation. The press corps are
penned in 100 metres out of sight of the action, only able to report that they
could not see anything. Evidence gatherers film and photograph everyone. <p>
Nameless ex-SAS balaclava'd `Men In Black'  are employed to dig the protesters
out, but are working at a painfully slow rate of a tunnel door a day, which
makes those in the know laugh at how long it will take.<p>
 Under Sheriff Randall `The Vandal' Hibbert, backed by hundreds of security and
bailiffs, hit the first of the seven tree camps at 3.45am on Tuesday May 20th.
Protestors sat around the campfire at Zion Tree say they were subjected to an
unprovoked truncheon attack by Greater Manchester Police. They deny involvement
but are `investigating'. It took 15 days before the last man was pulled from
the branches at Sir Cliff Richard OBE Vegan Revolution, Jimi Hendrix, River
Rats, Wild Garlic, and The-Camp-Of-Many-Names. `Leery' Flywood, the first camp
to be set up (known also as Babylon's Council Estate) featured Battlestar
Galactica, a multi-levelled tree fortress holding 14 people. It took cherry
pickers to get people out - and would have been unevictable had a tunnel been
at the base.<p>
One man, Carl, nailed his ear to a tree, and another was tied to a trunk in a
wheelchair. Russ and Tangle, who fought it out 80 feet up, announced they were
getting married as they were released from Wilmslow police station. There have
been 160 arrests during the campaign. One protester, Sharyn, who was jailed for
refusing bail conditions, went on hunger strike demanding proof that the prison
food was not genetically engineered. Local support is fantastic and half the
security are on our side.<p>
Zero Tolerance, a London kamikaze soundsystem, was tied into the trees in the
`We are Over Here' camp providing a surreal aural backdrop with the likes of
Girl from Ipanima, Vivaldi and banging techno ringing out depending on the
mood, while Sea Sabs mounted attacks down the Bollin River (owned by the Rivers
Authority not Manchester Airport). Now protesters say they will take their
campaign direct to the Airport itself, while others head South to fight Rank's
Centre Parcs development in Lyminge Forest, Kent.

<li>	<strong>AMEC</strong>, partner with TARMAC were invaded at their AGM on Wednesday by 25
protestors who stormed the stage and demanded - and got - a hour long meeting
with Chief Exec Sir Alan Cocksure - whose own two daughters have been
protesting against Runway 2. This Tuesday (June 10th) is Tarmac's AGM and
knackered Airport protesters could do with some solidarity. Call car2 and leave

<h3><A NAME="lyminge">Get Down T' 'Minge!</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>We all know you wanna have a battle with the Sheriff of
Nottingham, but despite our exhaustive enquiries Sherwood Forest is safe.
SchNEWS says: Get down the 'Minge! Rank have been granted permission to build a
new holiday park in Lyminge Forest, Kent. They bunged the Forestry Commision
&#163;4m - the price for 440 of yer finest ancient forest, West Wood, in an
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Oasis Village will include a Wonderwall
of 400 `forest lodges', 90 studio apartments, a large village centre with shops
and parking for 3,400 cars and lorries!!! Five tree camps are up and the
tunnelling's begun. Don't Look Back In Anger when the Oasis is built - get down
there! Even the local rag, the &quot;Hythe Herald' is saying &quot;THIS IS THE
NEXT BIG ONE!&quot;. Rank have already indicated that under pressure they'd
consider pulling out.

<strong></strong>Last week, those naughty protesters at the A30 campaign have
been entering the site where the Fairmile `University of Road Protest' site
once stood.  In just a week, an impressive tunnel snaked underground and an
early morning offensive saw the erection of barricades, a tripod, banners, two
lock-ons, and a fire. Pinkertons security guards, patrolling the site with due
diligence, did not once spot the nocturnal pixie activities...and even walked
twice past the fire without being alerted to any mischievous goings-on. The
first the police heard of the event was when local Gemini Radio station called
them to see if the story was true!
