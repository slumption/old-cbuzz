<A NAME="harass">DISCLAIMER...</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong>By reading this copy of SchNEWS you could find yourself being arrested
for breaking an injunction. We therefore recommend once you have memorised this
week's issue...you eat it...</strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;The Act is rightly broad in that it covers all forms
of harassing behaviour, not just stalking.&quot;<br></em><strong>- Police
Review</strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;The definition of harassment is far too vague and
general...applying to protesters and certain investigative journalists&quot;
<br></em><strong>- Liberty</strong><p>
Barely five weeks since it became law, the first major injunctions granted
under the new Protection from Harassment Act -  legislation intended to protect
women from stalkers - have been issued against animal rights activists. <p>
Two injunctions were granted by Mr Justice Moses in the High Court last
Wednesday. One put a 24-hour exclusion zone around the headquarters of the
British Field Sports Association during the Countryside Rally in Hyde Park on
Thursday, to deter anti-hunt protesters. The second bars 3 named activists,
Cynthia O'Neill, Natasha Dallemange and John Curtin, and <em>&quot;all
individuals and organisations holding themselves out as animal rights
activists&quot;  </em>from interfering with an Oxfordshire cat-breeder,
Christopher Brown, and his family. <p>
The first test of the injunction came last Thursday (10th July) when 20 people
demonstrated outside the British Field Sports Society HQ. BFSS solicitors
obtained an injunction forbidding anyone from a list of named groups or
<em>&quot;anyone who identifies themselves as an animal rights activist&quot;
</em>from going within 250 yards of the building. Despite that, the police
didn't seem too bothered about enforcing the injunction. <p>
At least 2 incidents must occur in order for a person to be arrested and
charged under the Act, but the breaking of these injunctions carries a sentence
of up to <strong>5 years</strong>. <p>
Liz Parratt, Liberty's Campaign Co-ordinator said, &quot;It's always depressing
to see our worst warnings come true. Using the new Act in this way will detract
from the aim of protecting genuine victims of harassment whilst adding to the
arsenal of criminal sanctions already available against legitimate protest. One
wonders how long it will be before the same provisions are used against
investigative journalists.&quot;<p>
As one activist told SchNEWS: &quot;This could be the thin end of the wedge. If
they get away with using these laws against animal rights activists then it
will give carte blanc to attack anybody involved in the direct action
movement.&quot;<p>
The Protection from Harassment Act was brought in after a flurry of media
attention about stalking last year. Used properly it can offer protection for
vulnerable people, but as it seems with so many of the new laws brought in it
is being directed at activists.<p>
Senior police officers are recommending that bail conditions should not be
offered to anybody arrested under charges created by the Act. This could mean
that <em>any</em>  activists accused of harassing animal abusers or company
directors, for example, could be instantly imprisoned and held on remand for
several months without any substantial evidence being produced.

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Good News! <strong>Consort - beagle breeders for vivisection -
are closing down!</strong> After 10 months of campaigning Consort have finally
given up after increasingly violent demonstrations. In April, local police used
CS Gas indiscriminately against protesters for the first time in this country.
60 people have been arrested for affray during the campaign, including one man
who was jailed for 4 months - for interfering with a witness - by attending a
demo outside a Consort workers home while on bail for assault (see SchNEWS

<A NAME="quarry">Protesters Occupy a Million Toilets</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Activists in Devon have set up a tree protest camp in response
to proposals for a Watts Blake Bearne (WBB) Group clay quarry extension -
providing raw materials for millions of toilets, washbasins and tiles. The
project has not been subject to a thorough environmental impact assesment and
the land is protected both by the EU Habitats Directive and the Wild Birds
Directive. The company want to divert  about 1km of the rivers Bovey and Teign
in an area that houses otters, kingfishers, bats and rare fish.  People needed
in this beautiful part of the country - give `em a bell on 0467 622825 for
directions.

<li>Protesters on the roof of the <strong>Liverpool Irish Centre</strong> trying
to stop the closure of the building were given a boost this week when chips,
kebabs and drinks were handed up to them by people out on the town waiting for
taxis.
<li>Operation Trident, Avon and Somerset's crack anti-drugs campaign were alerted
to a <strong>stash of cannabis</strong> being grown in Bath. A passer by
informed the Manvers Street Police station that 8 inch cannabis plants were
growing in the tubs outside the station amid the pansies. A spokesperson said
&quot;They had probably been planted as seeds by a joker, possibly connected to
the nearby Glastonbury Festival&quot; 
<li>Justice? will be going <strong>car bouncing</strong> on August 8th. The action
is proposed to be national so if anyone out there feels the urge to remove cars
from the pavements - call the office with ideas or approaches.

<li>Warwickshire Police have agreed to pay <strong>damages of &#163;15,500 to four
demonstrators</strong> who were arrested at Coventry Airport between Feb and
April 1995.  All 4 brought actions claiming damages for assault, unlawful
arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.  &quot;I hope that this
award will encourage people to stand up for what they believe in and not be
intimidated by the Police&quot; said one of the demonstrators

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;The fact that some jobs are less unpleasant than
others, and that individual workers have the nominal right to switch jobs,
start their own business, buy stocks or win a lottery, disguises the fact that
the vast majority of people are collectively enslaved</em>.&quot;<br><strong>-
Ken Knabb `Public Secrets'</strong><p>
<strong></strong>What would you say if all work stopped on the Newbury Bypass,
the second runway at Manchester airport or the Millennium Dome in Greenwich?
Would you applaud the thousands of people who have taken to direct action and
were physically stopping these destructive schemes going ahead? What, however,
if it was due to the workers on these sites taking strike action?<p>
At British Airways unions are voting to take industrial action, fed up with
being bribed and bullied by the New Labour darling Robert Ayling, BA's chief
executive. <p>
The head of the worlds most profitable airline wants to introduce paycuts and
longer hours - and has threatened anyone who wants to strike with the sack -
and is then offering to sue them for the privilege! He wants to save &#163;1
billion a year by 2000 although he managed to find &#163;60 million recently
re-designing plane tails. Why didn't you give us a call Mr Ayling? SchNEWS
could have set you up with some great graffiti artists for a fraction of the
price.<p>
Now SchNEWS, being good (and tongue-in-cheek!) environmentalists usually only
travel round the country using either a thumb, skateboard or magic carpet.
However the
holier-than-thou-I-can't-support-them-they-are-involved-in-the-devil's-work
attitude needs to be challenged. As one activist told us at the Earth First!
Gathering, &quot;a situation has been created where we all need money to live
and the majority of us have to sell ourselves into work which we don't control
or choose to do. If we adopt a moralist attitude it's missing the fundamental
point that its not the individual workers fault. We should support people when
they're in conflict 'cos they are resisting the way they are being
controlled&quot; So now you know....<p>
Not only that, but people change in struggle - you only have to chat to sacked
Liverpool dockers to find out what they think of the work ethic.<p>
So, forget your prejudices and if needs be get ready for a spot of flying
picketing...

<strong></strong>When a SchNEWS scribe phoned Strathclyde police stations
nosey-parker section to ask about excessive surveillance at the Earth First!
gathering their reply was <em>&quot;...erm, I'm not sure I understand you, I've
never heard of Earth First!&quot;</em>.  However, rumours suggest that the gathering
created the biggest police surveilance opperation in Scotland for 10 years.
With helicopters circling the camp, suspicious suited characters carrying
mobile phones posing as dustbin men (!), numerous marked and unmarked police
cars stopping and searching vehicles and an unknown amount of undercover cops
at the gathering this estimate may not be too much of an over estimation. Which
was quite funny - for as the police went overboard, bracing themselves for some
full on action, people instead did litter picking, cleared up a local pond and
built a disabled access ramp, much to the delight of the local youngsters, some
of  which commented &quot;We thought you were going to trash the nearby open
cast sites.&quot;  <em>What us? </em>
<ul>
<li>	Talamh Co-op are also colating information on police
harrasment, so if you received any grief drop 'em a line.
