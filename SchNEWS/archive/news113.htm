<h2><A NAME="workfare">SLAVE TRADE</A></h2>

<EM>&quot;Project Work is the thin end of a wedge which threatens
to enslave claimants, and to intensify exploitation and job insecurity for
those in work.&quot;</EM><BR>
- A Brighton claimant
<p>
Project Work was dealt a serious blow this week when the two organisations the
Employment Service had hoped would be involved suddenly withdrew their bids.
&quot;Tomorrow's People&quot; (part of Grand Met) and OTL have pulled out - and
without them the whole scheme could collapse. Work-fare is aimed at anyone
unemployed for two years or more. It means being forced into 8 weeks `intensive
job search' on signing day, being offered every job under the sun, with the
threat of all benefits being cut off under the Job Seekers Allowance if you
refuse any. This is followed by 13 weeks compulsory &quot;work
experience&quot;, for yer dole plus a tenner. Again, refusal could mean losing
all your benefits. <p>
Two pilot schemes have already been up and running in Medway and Hull since
April '96. Due to their so called &quot;success&quot; it's now being extended
to 25 areas (including Brighton) affecting 100,000 claimants. <p>
&quot;Success&quot;? It has the worst record of any job creation scheme - while
25% of claimants signed off, only 8% got jobs, and only half of those were
permanent. In Medway, of 1000 forced onto the scheme, only 9 were actually
found 13-week placements! <p>
In Hull, jobs included working in a quarry breaking rocks, and in Kent one man
died while working on scaffolding, polishing the front of a castle, due to poor
health and safety regulations. <p>
In New York, the authorities found that the only way to make a similar Workfare
scheme cost-effective was to place dole slaves in jobs otherwise done by
properly paid workers in the public sector. The result: within 2 years 10,000
workers in NYs sanitation depots had lost their jobs.<p>
SchNEWS wouldn't suggest kicking people when they're down but the scheme is
looking very wobbly and as one claimant activist told us: <em>&quot;Placement
agencies and `voluntary groups' may want free workers - but they don't want
pickets of their shops and disruption of their offices.&quot;</em><p>

<ul>
<li>	Not to be outdone by Old Conservative, New Labour plan to get 250,000
under 25's <strong>back to work</strong> with the help of the proposed
`windfall tax' (getting cash back from privatised utilities). You will be given
three options - and if you refuse will have your benefit withdrawn.
<li>	The Independent Benefits Advice Service give free <strong>confidential
advice to claimants</strong>. Much of their work is carried out in the Kent
area, but they will accept enquires from anywhere in the country, either by
mail or phone. 34 Saxon Place, Horton, Kirby, Dartford, Kent, DA4 9JG 01322
865114.
<li>	Edinburgh claimants are busy implementing the promised policy of
`<strong>three Strikes and you're out</strong>'. On March 13, a local dole
office was stormed and activists took photos of the offending client advisor,
one Alistair Mathieson - who has been warned twice by the group for harassment
of claimants. The group have promised to display large posters of the bully
around Edinburgh. Info c/o Peace &amp; Justice Centre, St. Johns Church,

<A NAME="legg">Legg Over</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;If we are not careful night-life will turn out to be
no different from the bland consumerist playground of chainstores and fast-food
outlets which punctuate the daytime economy.&quot;</em><br>
<em></em><strong>- Lovattr &amp; O'Connor, Institute for Popular
Culture</strong><p>
Barry Legg's Public Entertainments Licensing (drugs misuse) Bill finally became
law last Friday. It gives the police new powers to close a club immediately if
they suspect drug use/dealing is going on in the venue or at <strong>&quot;any
place nearby which is controlled by the holder of the licence&quot;.</strong><p>
The consequences of this Act will be to drastically change the character of our
clubland over the forthcoming months (that's unless you haven't noticed changes
happening already) Or as one disgruntled party-goer commented <em>&quot;under
the guise of `evil drug barons' they are using the tactics of searching and
watching our every move, to get us used to a police state&quot;</em>. The
Criminal Justice Act pushed the dance scene back into the clubs where events
could be more controlled by big business. This Act is designed to sterilise the
creativity of the event and its `consumers' and close smaller clubs in favour
of the larger commercially based venues. We can all look forward to increased
security on the doors, CCTV cameras inside the venue, and anti-drug patrols in
the club (including sniffer dogs at one Scottish club).<p>
Opponents of the Bill have been concerned that it will encourage people to take
too many drugs before entering the club, or that club competition may cause
&quot;snitching&quot; to local authorities resulting in immediate closure of
their rivals.
<ul>
<li>	Thanks to Brighton police <strong>The Sub caf&#233;</strong> along the seafront
has had to install a CCTV camera inside the venue!
<li>	London police took party bashing to new heights the other weekend when
they laid siege to a <strong>squatted old MI5 building</strong> with 14
sound-sytems ready to rock the night away. This follows on from a weekend when
they stopped three parties including illegally cutting the electricity supply
to one of the venues that was too well barricaded for them to enter.
<li><strong>	&quot;Shake a Legg&quot; Campaign</strong> was set up in
opposition to the bill. Now its an Act, what can we do? Any suggestions contact

<A NAME="housing">Housing Benefit Blues</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Last Friday Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley sneaked
through new housing benefit and funeral grants regulations.<p>
Housing Benefit cuts take place from October 6th and will eventually affect
370,000 people. <em>Any tenant under 60</em> who lives alone will be allowed
benefit equivalent only to the local average rent for a room in a shared house
with shared facilities. Lilley reckons it will encourage people on benefits to
&quot;shop around&quot; to find suitable accommodation - reality is a little
different. These changes have already happened for Under 25s, with the result
that in Brighton under 1% of private landlords will now take under 25s on
housing benefit; this is partly because &quot;average rent&quot; is set at
&#163;41.50! There just isn't enough affordable decent housing available and
landlords across the country won't be interested in people on benefits.<p>
Under funeral grant changes, poor families will be denied help with funeral
costs from the social fund unless they can prove all immediate relatives are on
benefit.

<h2>
<A NAME="bougain">Bougainville Update</A></h2>

<strong></strong>Around 100 Papua New Guinea (PNG) politicians spent Tuesday
night trapped in the parliament building by armed soldiers inside and
demonstrators outside. The then PM, Sir Julius Chan, enraged both the army and
demonstrators by spending &#163;23 million hiring a mercenary group consisting
of ex-special forces from Britain and South Africa and other charming thugs to
track down and murder the leaders of the Bouganville liberation movement.<p>
Bouganville is a small island about 500 miles north-west of mainland PNG, and
is unlucky enough to be the site of open-cast copper mining operations, which
account for one third of PNG's exports. There is of course no connection
between this fact and the government's willingness to spend millions on hired
killers to keep the island under their control. No, really, there isn't,
honest. As a result of the army mutiny - "why aren't we getting paid as much as
the mercenaries?" and the other demonstrations, the handsomely paid terrorists
have made a hasty exit, with the exception of their leader and paymaster who is
currently under arrest for illegally importing arms. As SchNEWS goes to press,
the latest is that Chan, his deputy and the defence minister have finally caved
in to the pressure and resigned. For more info call PaRTiZans on 0171 700 6189.

<A NAME="rank">Carry on rubbing up Rank</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>People have set up camp in Kent to oppose the Rank
Organisation's plans to build an up-market leisure facility in part of the
ancient Lyminge forest. This includes 850 buildings, interconnecting roads,
artificial waterways and a golf course which will affect 1,000 acres of wood
and farmland. Part of the land is currently owned by the Forestry Commission,
who have already been threatening to evict the camp, which has considerable
local support.<p>
Bodies, food and general support as ever are needed, so if you're looking for a
nice new place to live in the forest this summer... get involved by calling
01227 261057. You can also call Rank on 01730 262626. They're very sensitive
about their public image so this protest could really bang their gong.

<A NAME="bills">Royal Ass(ent)</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>At 11:39am last Friday, the last day of Parliament before the
General Election, the Conservatives fulfilled their scorched earth policy with
27 Bills becoming law in just one minute. These include the Police
we-have-the-right-to-bug-and-burgle-anyone-we-want-to Act, The Public
Entertainment we-have-closed-your-club-because-we-think-someone's-taking-drugs
Act, Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act, Confiscation of Alcohol (Young
Persons) Act and Road Traffic Reduction Act (see below). They also signed a deal to build
the first secure children's prison and kicked in regulations cutting housing
benefit and funeral grants for the poorest. <p>

Secretary of State for transport will consider when allocating funding to local
authorities for traffic reduction schemes. Charles Secrett from Friends of the
Earth said: <em>&quot;This is wonderful news and a momentous occasion in
transport history: for the first time ever a law has been passed that will
tackle growth rather than trying to accommodate it.&quot;</em><strong></strong>

Robbie. UEFA, however, were not amused, and fined him 2,000 Swiss Francs (about
&#163;750). On Monday night against Arsenal the referee awarded a penalty.
Fowler pleaded with the ref that it wasn't a foul and flunked the penalty kick.
The World football body FIFA are now patting him on the back for such
sportsmanlike conduct, while UEFA are slapping his wrists for defying their
ruling that &quot;a football ground is not the right stage for political
demonstrations.&quot; Unless it's the National Anthem, of course.
