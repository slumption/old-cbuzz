<h2>
<A NAME="europe">EUROVISION - MAKING YOUR MIND UP!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><strong>As Eurocrats quaff Bucks Fizz, it's time to kick them
in the Waterloos...</strong><p>
<strong></strong>Next month, Europe's leaders will come together in Amsterdam
for &quot;Son of Maastricht&quot;, to agree on the `convergence criteria' for a
single European currency. The aim of the meeting is to make Europe the third
global trade force to compete with the US-led American and the Japanese-led
Pacific regions. But to hit the criteria targets each nation that signs up has
to reduce its debts - and that means slashing welfare and stifling wages
rises.<p>
And <em>this</em> is the spark for the continuing strife raging all over the
continent for the past couple of years: a general strike in Greece; protests
throughout France, such as French lorry drivers paralysing the country and
winning all of their demands including retirement at 55; thousands of German
miners occupying Bonn in protest at the threat to slash industry subsidies...
the list goes on...<p>
Of course the whole &quot;Europe&quot; issue is, for most Brits, one big yawn
and seems quite irrelevant. But, as SchNEWS investigated, we discovered that if
big businesses get their wicked way, we could see any gains over the past 50
years go down the plug hole
<h3>
<A NAME="history">A Little History</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Long before most of us had ever heard of Maastricht, Britain's
multinationals were holding meetings in their boardrooms to talk about greater
integration with Europe. Since then, the multinationals have fought a long
campaign to get Britain into Europe, and when they see things are not going
their way, they turn up the heat and put the pressure on. <p>
When John Major made a concession to his Euro-sceptic backbenchers on a single
currency, the Financial Times published a letter of protest from Britain's top
multinationals, including BAT, British Aerospace, BP, Glaxo Wellcome, Guinness,
Shell and Unilever.<p>
European companies want to change to a single currency to avoid the cost of
currency-exchange. A united Europe, it is hoped, will do for European
corporations what the North American Free Trade Agreement has done for US
business. Pooling resources will help create a new &quot;strong&quot; currency
that can compete with the dollar on the world markets, and at the same time
being able to dominate and exploit poorer counties in eastern Europe and the
third world. <p>
However, all this can only be achieved by a massive attack on public
spending...<p>
The Maastricht Treaty requires governments wishing to join the new currency to
reduce their deficit (the gap between income and expenditure) to three per cent
of gross domestic product (GDP); and their debt (the amount they borrow to
reduce the deficit) to 60 per cent of GDP. 
<ul>
<li>	The poorest 10% of the British population are now getting &#163;13 a week
less than 20 years ago whilst the top 1% get an extra &#163;900 thanks to tax
cuts - <strong>The Economist</strong>
<li><strong></strong>	According to the European Union 50 million people in
Europe are already living in poverty.</ul>To give you an idea of the scale of
cut-backs required to meet these targets, Italy's deficit in 1995 was 7.4 of
GDP and government debt was 125%. Belgium was close to target on its deficit -
3.2% - but could only manage this by running up a government debt of
<em>134%</em>. Last year the French government needed to cut &#163;7-8 billion
in just 18 months to meet the criteria.<p>
To see what's in store for the rest of Europe, you only have to look at
England. 18 years of Conservative rule has meant massive cuts in social
provision, the breaking of any effective trade union movement and the
introduction of a low-paid &quot;flexible&quot; workforce. But even that isn't
enough. As the day for a single currency draws nearer, all over Europe
governments are embarked on a new austerity drive. As Andy from
<strong>Revolution</strong><em> </em>told SchNEWS, <em>&quot;In a Britain
already ravaged by years of cutbacks, a further &#163;18-&#163;25 billion could
be cut from spending in pursuit of the Maastricht convergence
criteria.&quot;</em> Or as one sacked Liverpool docker said,<em> &quot;The
Maastricht Treaty is a Thatcher treaty." </em><p>
Already, workfare has been introduced in Holland and Belgium. Italy, Portugal
and Spain have <em>increased</em> the retirement age or plan to do so. Family
allowances in Belgium and Germany are now means-tested, as is the pension in
Norway, Holland and Spain. In Denmark, income support is now taxed. The German
government, under pressure from the costs of unification, is planning to cut
unemployment benefit, sick pay, health-care, child benefits and holiday pay; to
raise the age of retirement; to freeze public sector pay for two years; and to
withdraw legal protection for workers in companies with 10 or less employees.
And this is only just the beginning...<p>
As one anti European activist told SchNEWS <em>&quot;Who will win this
particular round in a struggle that is only just beginning remains unclear.
Governments face major difficulties meeting the Maastricht criteria and popular
protest is only making it harder, but if the voice of ordinary people is to be
heard a way must be found of uniting and breaking the stranglehold of the
official opposition, otherwise, we will all be made to pay the price of the
system's endless search for profits.&quot;</em><p>
Don't worry - SchNEWS isn't getting all xenophobic - we all like a bottle of
French red-wine, Spanish strawberries and the odd German (soya) sausage. As
Richard from Revolution put it, <em>&quot;We don't want a little England
mentally just as much as we don't want a Europe controlled by the Bundesbank -
but a Europe under the control of ordinary people.&quot;</em> We'll drink a
case of yer finest Bordeaux to that!

<li>	Euromarch! People on 30 different marches from 17 different countries are
making their way towards Amsterdam, arriving for a massive rally in the city on
14th June. They are marching against mass unemployment, poverty and job
insecurity in Europe. This is apparently the first time there's ever been an
all European demo. More info:

Spanish anti-immigration laws. <!-- KOKO that's a sub  of above actually -->
<li>	LegalizE StreetParty 15/16/17 June. SchNEWS has heard that rather a large

<ul>
<li>	More than &#163;6 million has so far been spent on the evictions, which
will probably take another 2 1/2 weeks. 
<li>	Liz, was locked on by her hands and feet with a noose around her neck, was
taken out from a tunnel on Wednesday from the &quot;Sir Cliff Richard OBE Vegan
Revolution Camp&quot;. There is also the tale of the geezer who nailed his ear
to a tree. There are Tactical Assault Group Police on site who are snatching
people at every opportunity, especially at night. Bailiffs pulled a woman out
of a tree by her ankles on Wednesday.
<li>	Sharyn Lock, (BE4262) is currently on hunger strike in HMP Risley
demanding that her prison diet is free from genetically modified food.
<li>	Bailiffs have built an illegal dam across the river Bollin in order to
prevent further <em>&quot;SAS Style Armada invasions&quot;</em> by protesters
like what happened on Monday.
<li>	The Zion Tree, Wild Garlic and Jimi Hendrix camps have now gone, but at
least three remain, including the biggest - Flywood. 
<li>	Tr(u)ee romance blossomed this week at Wild Garlic when Russ, a 26 year
old self employed window fitter, proposed to Tangle, a student at John Moores
University. The couple are also planning to call their first child Ashley after
the Ash tree they were living in, and are pleading to the Under Sheriff to
allow them to take a clipping before all the trees are destroyed.

<A NAME="terminal">Expansion of Heathrow's Terminal 5 (T5)</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Stansted &amp; Gatwick could all become major projects in the
not so distant future. The Heathrow inquiry  is in its third year and is not
expected to finish until late 1998. If it goes ahead, T5 will be the largest
green belt development in UK history, destroying 625 acres of protected London
green belt - and the planned M25 link road another 50 acres. 4 rivers - the
Colne, Crane, Duke of Northumberland and Longford - will be either culverted or
filled with de-iceing and aviation fuel run-off (just above a SSSI and the
point where London extracts its drinking water). T5 will, in its own right,
become the third biggest airport in Europe, behind Frankfurt and the rest of
Heathrow (already on 3000 acres of greenbelt!). The development will include a
terminal building, offices, hotels, shopping malls and <em>21,000 car parking
spaces</em>. If you want to know more contact FoE on 0171 566 1678.<em></em>

<ul>
<li>	Villagers in Bjorke, Norway chained a telephone booth to four boulders and
guard it in shifts, after the state TeleNor company said it was
<strong>unprofitable</strong> and would be removed.
<li><strong>	SoundKlash</strong> @ The Event, Brighton on Monday 2nd June. Live

<li>	A nice little victory: <strong>LETS</strong> (Local Exchange Trading
Scheme) units have been accepted for the first time as earnings in a claim for
<strong>Family Credit</strong> by Helen Frances of Frome LETS. She's happy to
provide advice to anyone making a similar claim. 01373 451386
<li>	Not just a labour victory on May 1st: Holtsfield Chalet Community, near
Swansea, who were living under threat of eviction from property scumbag Tim
Jones, won their case in the House of Lords. This is the most significant
<strong>land rights</strong> decision for a decade as it questions the age old
feudal law giving the land owner absolute right to the land beneath tenants'
homes - which could have positive results for travellers, gypsies and others.
<li>	This week the first disciplinary charges are to be brought against a cop
for over-zealous use of <strong>CS gas</strong>. Details are scanty, but it
seems a Cambridgeshire rozzer is on a charge of <em>&quot;abusing his
authority&quot;</em> in respect of an incident during 6-month trials in
Peterborough in March `96
<li><strong>	Pressmennan Woods</strong>: 25 miles from Edinburgh lies this
13,000 year old oak woodland - which considerate landowner John Kinnaird wants
to substantially thin <em>&quot;for the enjoyment of future
generations&quot;</em>. What John forgets to admit is that this thinning, which
would severely damage the woodland ecosystem, enables the felled trees to be
flogged to BMW for car dashboards. A camp's already set up, so come and defend
the wood. The owner is likely to back down if enough people oppose. Tel. 0131
228 2193 or 01368 850630.
<li>	Between 17-19 Apr. 8 people were nicked at Pressmennan and charged under
the <strong>1865 Trespass (Scotland) Act</strong> - a law brought in to stop
displaced crofters reoccupying their crofts after the Highland Clearances! The
cops claimed to be acting on behalf of the landowner, though the Bughts camp
(where the arrests took place) is widely believed to be common land, and there
is no record of ownership in the last 300 years. The eight want people to write
to the Prosecutor Fiscal (like the CPS): tel 0131 657 4392.
<li>	Head State Support Group is being set up to provide legal and
letter-writing help for folk who feel mentally unstable from too much direct
action. If you want or can offer help, have been sectioned or know someone who
has, contact: &quot;Witches Green&quot;, 54 Mill Rd, North Lancing, West
Sussex, BN15 OPZ.

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Under New Labour everything has changed - no one gets
hangovers any more, dropped toast lands butter side up, and condoms never
split. However, some things have remained the same. The wallets of the few are
growing fatter, and the fat cats are lapping up ever richer cream. Directors of
Camelot, administrators of the National Mockery,  have just given themselves a
90% pay increase. Peter Jarvis, the Chief Exec of Whitbread, who scrapes by on
&#163;521 <strong>an hour</strong>, has been put forward as the person to look
after the Low Pay Commission which will decide the minimum wage! What next -
Genghis Khan as Minister of Human Rights? Tony Blair asking Margaret Thatcher
for advice? <p>
That's not all. The Head of BP has become Minister for European Competition,
and Martin Taylor, man of notes at Barclays has become head of the task force
on welfare reform. Nice to see someone appointed with empathy for the people
affected by the changes; who knows what it's like to save coppers in a whiskey
bottle. There's more - Lord Hollick, responsible for sacking hundreds of people
from Anglia TV and the Express, is a special advisor to Dept of Industry. New
