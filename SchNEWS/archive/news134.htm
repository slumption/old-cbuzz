The Musa Anter Peace Convoy, carrying around two hundred European
delegates on a peace mission to Kurdistan, was ambushed in a huge
military operation by the Turkish army and police last week.<p>

Twenty-four people were arrested when riot police stormed a banned
press conference in Istanbul on Thursday, including an Italian MP and
the UK Vice Consul for Press and Public Affairs. Two were badly
injured, one with arterial bleeding from a foot wound and another
suffered brain haemorrhage when thrown against a van. The diplomats
were released but the others were detained for three days then
deported.  <p>

British freelance photographer Julia Guest was the first
to be arrested. She told SchNEWS: <em>"I've been in Cambodia and
Indonesia and this is easily the most brutal show of force I've ever
witnessed. I think it has done a lot for people to really see what's
going on"</em>.  <p>

Twenty-four hours earlier 15 members of the
organising committee and two Swiss delegates were seized when police
raided the convoy heading back to Istanbul from a rally in the
unofficial capital of Kurdistan, Diyarbakir. It was the eighth time
the convoy had been stopped as it was chased 500km by the army. In
Diyarbakir itself, 2000 people attending the rally were detained
inside a stadium and forty "leaders" kept for three days. Reports
indicate they were tortured and one still remains in detention.
<P>Originally delegates were to have travelled on a "Peace Train" from
Brussels but it never left the station, after Germany said it would
refuse entry. Instead delegates flew in to Istanbul and travelled in
convoy of 57 coaches to the East for International Peace Day on 1st
September. The government issued an emergency decree to block an
expected one and a half <em>MILLION</em> people arriving from across
Turkey in Diyarbakir. All this has been virtually unreported in the
British press. <P>

Those involved included the head of the National
Union of Teachers, Christine Blower, Lord Rea and Bruce Kent, Vice
President CND who were thrown out of Diyarbakir. He said: <em>"The
police simply said we were supporting the terrorist organisation
PKK. No discussion was allowed."</em> <P>

Also present was Frances
D'Souza, Executive Director of Article 19, an international
organisation named after the section in the universal Declaration of
Human Rights which states that <em>"everyone has the right to freedom
of opinion and expression". She said: "The systematic silencing of
legitimate political and other voices by the most brutal means is
growing in Turkey. One now has to question whether the Turkish
government is in fact controlling the military. These actions are an
outrageous and blatant infringement of all international treaties of
which Turkey is a part"</em>.  

<P>The Kurdish people, at 35 million,
are the largest stateless people on Earth and their culture and
language is banned (see headline). Since 1984, 4000 villages have been
burnt and evacuated, three million villagers disappeared and over
20,000 killed according to the Kurdistan Information Centre.  The
Peace Convoy was named after Musa Anter, the "grand old man of Kurdish
culture" who was gunned down by death squads in Diyarbakir five years
ago this month.  <P>

Turkey's left-wing had dubbed the mission a
"terrorist train". The ANC's Jassan Soloman, South African Minister
for Foreign Affairs, after his return from the peace mission attended
a 100,000 strong rally in Cologne. He told the crowd: <em>"I bring
greetings to all of you from comrades in Kurdistan. We fought against
racism and we were killed and disappeared... we were called
terrorists.  Today you are suffering what we suffered. We know what
the Turkish Government is doing and I want you to know that I am a
part of you and I am with you"</em>. He said he recognised PKK as the
leadership of Kurdish people. Its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, has been
likened to Nelson Mandela.
<ul>

<li>Tory MP for Aldershot, Gerald Howarth - (01252) 518078 - has
called for the 300 Kurdish refugees who demonstrated outside the Arms
Fair at Farnborough on 1st Sept(see <A HREF="news133.htm"> SchNEWS
133)</A> to be sent back to their own country (sic). <em>"These people
have caused a great inconvenience, wasted police time and incurred
great expense over a domestic dispute many miles away. They should not
be allowed further freedom of these islands"</em> he said. UK company
Vickers has bid for a &#163;3 billion order for 800 battle tanks,
almost certainly for use in the 13 year war with the Kurds. Turkey
spends &#163;6 BILLION each year on "defence", helped in part with the
cash from seven million tourists annually. Campaign Against the Arms
Trade said: <em>"We condemn the complicity of the British Government
and UK companies who share the responsibility of the repression of the
Kurdish people by arming the Turkish regime"</em>.

<A NAME="gandalf"><h2>Gandalf Trial</h2> </A>

Last weekend's "Alternative Media Gathering" in
Oxford - attended by over seventy representatives of various radical
publications - issued a statement in support of the editors from Green
Anarchist and the Animal Liberation Front Support Group
newsletters. Five people from these publications are currently on
trial in Portsmouth on the ridiculous charges "conspiracy to incite
persons unknown to commit criminal damage" (see SchNEWS 130). They
face up to 10 years inside for the heinous crime of reporting on
direct action. As the statement points out, <em>"If the reporting of
direct action can constitute incitement this has very worrying
implications for freedom of speech... It is not the reporting of
direct action which incites further direct action; environmental
degradation, animal abuse, economic injustice, attacks on freedom,
weapons exports, nuclear weapons, lack of democratic process - these,
among many others, are the inciting factors. The attack on Green
Anarchist and the Animal Liberation Front Support Group Newsletter is
an attack on freedom and an attack on us all."</em>

<p>They are asking for as many publications, organisations and
individuals to sign in support. To see the whole statement contact
Corporate Watch 01865 791 391; e-mail - <a
href="mailto:mail@corporatewatch.i-way.co.uk">mail@corporatewatch.i-way.co.uk</a>.

<A NAME="dockers"><h2>Dockers International Day of Action</h2></A>

The day of action last Monday in support of the 500 sacked Liverpool
dockers saw an encouraging show of international solidarity. Ports in
Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, India, Canada, the United States,
Australia, Ireland and South Africa took part. South African dockers
have also made public their intention to boycott all trade involving
Mersey Docks, and they plan to halt any fruit which is bound for the
UK Port of Sheerness (100 percent owned and operated by the Mersey
Docks and Harbour Company.) In London Reclaim The Street activists
picketed the house of Mersey Docks Chairman Gordon Waddell with a
banner "Injustice is not Anonymous, it has a name and Address" before
moving onto scab employment agency Drakes International.

Faslane Peace Campers spent the days running up to 9th September (the
date of the last convoy to arrive at the nuclear submarine base)
engaging in some naughty nocturnal digging activities. A tunnel only
30ft from the gate was dug under the road, with the intention of
making it unsafe to be driven over by the 3 warhead carriers. The
tunnel went unnoticed by the ever-vigilant MOD police. As the convoy
approached the base it drove towards the gate made inaccessible by the
secret tunnel, the other gate having been blockaded by activists. The
Peace Campers halted the convoy in front of the tunnel by covering it
in paint. They then attempted to place a portable lock-on behind the
convoy. The convoy was halted for around 15 minutes and excellent
press coverage was gained. The action, involving around 25 activists,
only led to the arrest of four, three for breach of the peace and one
for criminal damage.  <P>The camp, which still hasn't received an
eviction order - is holding a party on 26-27th of September and a
"Shut It!" action on 18-19th of October. Faslane: 01436 820901.

68 allotment holders at Hazel Grove in Stockport have refused a
&#163;1,000 per head bribe by Tesco's to pinch their land. The Hazel
Grove Allotment Holders Association turned down a package including a
free greenhouse, tool shed, watering system, state of the art security
and five rent free years on a newly dug plot - freshly dug in time for
the growing season, all offered by the supermarket giant. The four
acre allotment site lie inconveniently where Tesco want to build (yet
another!) multi million pound superstore. <em>"The allotments have
been worked for eighty years"</em> said John Burrows, chairman of the
allotment association, <em>"A lot of my members are retired and
wouldn't want to start again on virgin land."</em><P>

Even Stockport Metropolitan District Council have backed the diggers,
refusing Tesco's &#163;6million offer for the land - despite being
&#163;12 million in debt. A Tesco spokesperson told SchNEWS: <em>"We
are puzzled as to why they turned down our generous offer. We are now
considering our position."</em>

<A NAME="oil"><h2>100 Days of Action Against the Oil Industry</h2></A>

The 100 days of action against the oil industry kicked off on the 23rd
of August with pickets of around 25 BP garages around the
nation. Lincolnshire activists disrupted the grand opening of a new
garage, and a roof top protest in London's Park Lane attracted armed
police! Whilst the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation) summit
met in Edmonton, Alberta on the 23rd, an APEC counter conference was
held to highlight the effect of the petrochemical industry on humans
and the environment. A warm-up event to the 100 days of action saw
activists invade the London offices of the oil giant Chevron (owners
of Gulf Oil), responsible for the development of Cardigan Bay.
Activists barricaded themselves into the top floor of the building and
"adjusted" the company's computer system and adorned the exterior with
"STOP THE DRILLING" banners for three hours.  The Friends of Cardigan
Bay campaigners are claiming a victory, for within days of the action,
Chevron not only announced a delay but also agreed to conduct an
Environmental Impact Assessment into the scheme.  <P>Future 100 Days
events include The Fuming Mad Rally to cut traffic levels, 27th
Sept. 2pm Trafalgar Square. The following day, 28th, sees a Lobby of
the Labour Party Conference "End Links With Colombian Death Squads"
meet 2pm at Brighton Conference Centre.  <P>London's underground
"Subvertising" agency is calling for oil related billboards to be
"improved", send good pictures to 100 Days Update, Box CW, 111

The good thing about living in Brighton is that you get to go to loads
of exciting conferences and fringe meetin..zzzzzz. This week it was
the turn of the Trade Union Congress and with the CBI telling us
�Business people have a high regard for John Monks (the TUC general
secretary, who on the opening day told delegates "don't dream to
much") we could tell we were in for a scream. Some delegates dressed
as dinosaurs, others posing with jugglers - what next? Enter Tony
Blair. Wagging his finger at the assembled delegates, he preached: �We
have nothing to lose but our dogmas...We will not go back to the days
of industrial warfare, strikes without ballots, mass and flying
pickets, secondary action and all the rest of it..." On employment
rights: "there are bigger battles to fight" and don't forget the new
God - "flexibility of the present labour market". Which means do as
you're told - or you're sacked. Ask the Liverpool Dockers, sacked
Magnet workers, sacked Critchley Label workers from South Wales... now
what was that joke doing the rounds - a sermon from the PM - politics
from the archbishop of Canterbury.
