<h2><A NAME="bougain">Ecological Revolution on Bougainville</A></h2>

<strong>Bouganville, with a population of only 160,000 has managed to close one
of the biggest copper mines in the world. Despite having to fight the armed PNG
army, they have held their ground for 8 years with antique guns &amp; homemade
guns made out of water piping and planks.</strong><p>
<em>&quot;We now understand and have seen with our own eyes
the destructive effects of the Copper mine operations on our land, our
environment, our society and our culture. The mine will remain closed for the
rest of our lives.&quot;</em><br>
- Declaration of Panguna Landowners, December 1992<P>
<em></em>Bougainville Island lies only 7km west from the nearest of the Solomon
Islands. It's population is estimated to be 160,000. Originally colonised by
the Dutch, it then fell under German and, after World War 1, Australian
control. Despite close cultural and geographical links with the Solomon
Islands, it was governed as part of Papua New Guinea (320 miles to the west).
When PNG was given `independence' in 1975, Bougainville Island was placed under
its flag.<p>
In 1969 CRA, an Australian subsidiary of the British mining giant - Rio Tinto
Zinc - forcibly established a copper mine on Bougainville. From the beginning
the island's people resisted the construction of the mine. News footage of
Bouganvillean women, fighting with riot police over CRA survey pegs, received
international coverage. In Bougainville, women are the traditional landowners -
land is passed from `woman to woman'. To put it lightly, on this occasion it
was clear their land was not being passed on in a traditional manner. The
building of the mine saw 800 villagers landless and another 1,400 without
fishing rights as land was seized and rainforest cleared. The subsistence life
of gardening and fishing was destroyed. 220 hectares of rainforest was
poisoned, felled, burned and bulldozed. After 20 years the mine had grown to a
huge crater half a kilometre deep and nearly 7km in circumference, creating
over a billion tonnes of waste. This was dumped into the Jaba River Valley
creating a wall of waste hundreds of metres high, turning one of the islands
biggest river systems bright blue.<p>
In 1988, after two decades of ignored protests, petitions and compensation
claims Bougainvilleans had had enough. A handful of islanders stole company
explosives destroying electricity pylons, buildings and machinery. By using
guerilla tactics they succeeded in closing the mine. Until the war broke out in
1988, the mine accounted for around 45% of all Papua New Guinea's total export
earnings. Without these earnings PNG is quickly going bust. Papua New Guinea
(PNG), with the assistance of Australia, responded by sending in the military.
Following this, Bougainville declared itself independent from the PNG and the
Bougainvilleans formed the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) to defend
their land and their environment from further exploitation.<p>
<em>&quot;We wouldn't stand idle and see our boys and innocent people being
killed so we had to stand up and defend somehow, and it was then that we
thought of forming a militant type organisation to contain what the security
forces were doing to us.&quot;</em><BR>
<em></em>- BRA Spokesperson<p>
The Bougainvilleans are getting no outside aid from any country, they are
seriously outgunned, yet they have fought off PNG for eight years with antiques
and homemade guns made out of water piping and planks. Springs from old mining
machinery make reliable firing mechanisms. PNG transports its troops around in
military trucks and helicopters. The Bougainville Revolutionary Army makes do
with a small amount of company vehicles it took from the the mine, which it
runs on coconut oil.  A group of villagers working for about 20 hours can
produce enough fuel to drive a 4WD vehicle 50 miles over rough terrain. Coconut
Oil quite literally fuels the revolution. It not only powers `Radio Free
Bougainville' it also powers the lathes which the BRA use to turn the water
pipes from the mine into home made gun barrles.
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading2">10,000 Dead in Australias Secret War</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>The Australian government claims that it does not support
PNG's war on the people of Bougainville. IT'S LYING. Australia has been
funding, arming and directing the PNG military since the beginning. Australia
provides Papua New Guinea with $32 million in military aid plus much more in
untied aid.  Almost half of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has been trained
in Australia since the beginning of the crisis. Austalian military advisors are
on the island directing PNG army operations. Guns &amp; ammunition used by the
PNG army are manufactured and/or supplied by Australia.<p>
Australian intelligence also advised Papua New Guinea to enforce a total goods
and service blockade of the island, including medical supplies. No one is
allowed on or off the island. Many of those trying to carry supplies in or
refugees out have been killed by the PNG army who maintain a stranglehold
around the island thanks to the Australian-provided patrol boats, speedboats,
Iroquois helicopters and Nomad aircraft. When advising PNG to blockade, they
anticipated that Bougainvilleans would succumb to the hardships in &quot;3-4
weeks&quot;.  Six years after this projection Bougainvilleans are still under
siege and are showing no signs of surrender.<p>
PNG and Australia are committing genocide - the planned destruction of a
people. Since the start of the war thanks to massacres and preventable diseases
10,000 Bougainvilleans have died - 7% of the population. In an attempt to
isolate the Bougainvillean Revolutionary Army (BRA) from the civilian
population, the PNG military has been demolishing villages and herding the
villagers into `care centres'.  `Care centres' are the PNG's preferred term for
concentration camps.<p>
<em>&quot;Bougainvilleans agree that environmental concerns cannot be
disassociated from human concerns. 'Environment' encompasses both ecological
and cultural rights; the two are too often sacrificed side by side. Government
tactics such as forced evictions and population transfers are part and parcel
of development that, in the name of economic growth, justify ecological
destruction and the dispossession of peoples. The intent of the perpetrators of
this evil blockade and seige is to create disunity on the islands through
suffering and death, to torture women and children into submission, to steal
back the mining resources at the expense of society and environment, to own the
people and their island&quot;</em><BR>
<em></em>- Martin Miriori, Bougainville Interim Government.<p>
Australia has many reasons for trying to destroy the Bougainville rebellion.
The main reasons are its industrial and geopolitical interests. The Rio Tinto
Zinc subsidiary (CRA) that owned the mine is Australian and the resistance on
Bougainville could seriously weaken Australia's hold on the region. As
mentioned above, from 1918 to 1975 (with a brief interruption during the 2nd
World War) Papua New Guinea was run under colonialism by Australia. PNG became
an independent (sic) state in 1975 and was shaped by Australia as a block
between it and the evolving regional superpower - Indonesia. PNG's western
sponsored power elites control of it its own population is very unstable. PNG
is not welded together by a common language or culture, but is still mainly
tribal. Many have declared their wish to, as a common saying goes, `do a
Bougainville'. The PNG military has been greatly weakened by the loss of
revenue from the mine, and if the BRA were successful it would almost
definitely trigger similar struggles for self rule on the mainland. In such a
situation the PNG military could simply collapse. Indonesia (which is already
in forced occupation of neighbouring West Papua), would probably take
advantaged of the power vacuum and invade PNG. This would seriously weaken
Australian power in the region.
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading3">Your Darkest Hour has Arrived</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>This message to Bougainvilleans can be attributed to the PNG
Prime Minister and comes from a televised address to the nation (21.3.96). PNG
is not interested in peace. When BRA reps turned up for peace talks in `95,
they were fired on by PNG troops. As you read this the PNG military is
launching its biggest ever offensive. Their orders are printed below. Reports
are coming in of land mines being laid. Guess which country provided them? We
need to tell the world about Australia's secret war, it has taken great lengths
to hide its level of involvement in Bougainville - we need to expose it. We
have to target the offices of Australian interests in Britain, target the
mining company RTZ. We need to raise money for medical aid. Against the odds
Bougainvilleans have managed to hold their ground. It's up to us to carry out
the vital work of taking their struggle global. Let's pull together and support
Bougainville.<p>
<em>&quot;Land is our life, land is our physical life - food and sustenance.
Land is our social life, it is marriage; it is status; it is security; it is
politics; in fact, it is our only world.  When you take our land, you cut out
the very heart of our existence.&quot;</em><p>

Victory to the BRA!<p>
Victory to the People of Bougainville!

<A NAME="Heading4">A few words from Marcelline Tunin, a Bougainvillean woman</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>&quot;Our fish in the river sometimes we would find them dead,
floating. Some times even fish in the sea. Each time we reported this to the
health officers. Nothing was ever done about it. Every time we complained they
would say it'll be alright.  It'll be alright; you will get the money, but
money compared to what we lost is nothing.<p>
In January 25th of 1990 my brother went to work as usual, the security forces
went to him and told him not to say anything. He tried to ask them why they
were taking him but he was bashed with the butt of the gun. He was beaten up,
ripped off his clothes, thrown in the back of the car where ten of the soldiers
were sitting  and he was driven off.  He was still screaming when they got
their gun and they somehow maybe they hit the side of his mouth with their gun
and two of his teeth fell off. Then he was shot in his heart once and another
time in his side.<p>
The PNG cannot win our hearts because we cannot forget our loved ones. We
cannot accept it, they killed us in cold murder. We have never experienced
things like this in our lives, the only place where I saw similar things was on
TV.&quot;<p>
<H3>ORDER 2133 - Papua New Guinea Defence Force 21st May 1996</H3>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Search for the rebels and kill them.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Any civilians who are
suspected harbouring the BRA must be killed without question.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Get the rebels out. Do not leave any of them, but wipe them out.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Destroy all food - gardens, houses and any shelter found in the jungle,
clean it up.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Any civilian found to be an ordinary civilian is to be forced into care
centres. If anyone is disorderly they must be beaten, but do not cause them
death.&quot;

of theses bombs make contact with the skin, they create wounds which do not
heal, especially with a blockade preventing access to medicines. The wounds go
gangrenous, limbs drop off, people die.-->
