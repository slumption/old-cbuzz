"The Newbury bypass was conceived in the 1960's, planned in the 1970's and out of date by the 1980's.  Shouldn't the Department of Transport start living in the 1990's?" <p>

" We've got away from the 'let's just cost them loads of money'.  The idea is to stop this road and with the preparation and organisation we've got, we can. (underline)  One of the biggest direct actions ever to take place was against the proposed damming of the Franklin River in Tasmania when David Bellamy got nicked.  That succeeded  because of the massive amount of planning, preparation and imagination that went into it.  If people can do it there, we can certainty do it here."  <p>

Week Two of the Third Battle of Newbury.<br> As the March deadline approaches (EC directive means that trees cannot be felled during the nesting season) the cat and mouse game between security, police and people trying to stop the bypass hots up.  So far it's been estimated that just half a mile of the eight and a half mile site has been cleared of trees!  However more and more security guards are being drafted in and people are needed desperately.<br>
Police have now begun to flex their  Criminal Justice Act muscles with the catch-all aggravated trespass. "Aggravated trespass" was specifically aimed at hunt sabs and road protestors.  <br>
The police are also using their new powers under Section 27 of the CJA to stop people protesting.  By aresting protesters and imposing restrictive bail conditions, they are preventing people returning to the scene of the dispute.  People being nicked are being told not to return to within one km from where they've been nicked.  Trial dates are being set for up to and over 6 months from the time of arrest.  This results in an increasing number of protestors unable to participate in demos.  This action of preventing people from kickin up a fuss runs in opposition to our right to peaceful protest especially if the defendent is later found innocent.  <p>

Government are looking into stopping benefit payments to the "tree people". Dept of Transport officials are said to believe the plan to starve the activists of income would halve the number of protesters at the Berkshire site!  An insider at Social Security said "don't believe everything you read in the papers". <br> 

Over 500 trees were planted in Newbury by activists on Sunday to  counter the ones chopped down last week.  Police and the Highways Agency said they were powerless to stop the planting!  Eh?<br>
 
"The first week was totally amazing and exhiliterating but people didn't get any 
sleep.  Now we are on to the second week people are getting tired and we desperately need fresh energy and imagination.  If people want to come up and stay that's fine but the best thing people can do is come up for a couple of days a week.  There's so many ideas and skills we have that we need people to come up and help make them work."<p>

The campaign is taking many twists and turns and is involving a cross section of people involved for the first time in direct action.

On Wednesday a group of Newbury businessman launched Business Against Bypass.   Adrian Foster-Fletcher, an executive headhunter who has attended protests in his Jaguar, said the community had only woken up to this issues when anti-road protesters arrived "We were told the M25 would solve all our problems, but it didn't." <br>
And in the post SchNEWS received a letter from Alan Page, a resigning Liberal Democrat sickened by their support for the bypass: <br>
"As a 30 + year supporter of the Liberal cause and more recently as an executive local officer I have no desire to be associated with a movement which has torn up its environmental credibility in such an ignorant manner.  My personal observations of British provincial towns, including Newbury, is that we have become choked with heavy lorries and single occupant private motor cars.  Eradicate this and we have manageable road space for all and we keep our countryside free of destruction.  I have informed my bank not to honour the direct debit agreement with the Liberal Democrat Party.  I will send the subscription to the Newbury protestors instead"<br>
And SchNEWS, when questioning the Liberal Democrats Press Office on the contradiction between their so-called 'green' transport policy and their support for the road, were told "The time for protest is over" !  <p>

Which just goes to show you that all the main parties show the same contempt for people power and would have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  fight to ensure that this area remains one in which we can all be very proud to live." 1.4.93<p>

"The bypass is being built primarily in order to speed the traffic from Southampton to Birmingham and back again rather than to solve Newbury's problems."  1.4.93<p>

"Of course, I welcome the Government's announcement today that they have at last recognised that it is fatuous to go on building more new roads instead of investing in public transport and doing up the present structure.  But..."  19.12.94<p>

From the A34 in Newbury take the A343 towards Andover. After about 4 miles turn right at the cross-roads (brown signpost marked Herb Garden). After about 50 yards, park on the left hand side and walk up a dirt track on the right hand side 
(signposted Blindmans Gate Cottage). Walk past the yellow skip and keep going to the camp....... There's water, electricity, compost loos, wicked woods...........

First time protesting - a guide (incl. what to do if get arrested). Getting nicked is no threat, 90% acquitted anyway, leaving you open to sue them for wrongful arrest. Use figures to show it is politically motivated and scandalous!<p>

*It never rains but it pours. Just when you thought the last major road scheme was starting, a whole new generation of road building begins. The contract for the first DBFO (Design, Build, Finance and Operate) privately financed route was awarded, shrouded in much DoT secrecy... As the Carpenters once sang "we've only just 
begun"<p>
* February 11th  Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace organising big rally in Newbury.  More details to follow.<p>
*  If you'd like to argue with a load of students about the pros and cons of the by-pass go to the Debating Chamber at the University Sussex Campus next Wednesday (24th) 12.30 pm .<p>
*The head of Gwent police has refused to deny that CS gas, to be given to 2000 police from 16 forces at the end of March, would be used against anti-roads protestors. "They will be used in the same situations that we use truncheons and handcuffs at the moment......" There will be more on both CS and pepper gas in next weeks SchNEWS.

<p>
You can only be charged with this in relation to some lawful activity (eg bulldozing trees, hunting foxes, playing golf, picking your nose). <br>

To be charged under section 68 you have to be trespassing on open private landand the lawful activity has to be happening or about to happen on that land.  You have to do something to try and obstruct or disrupt the activity, or  intimidate the people to stop them carrying out the lawful activity (eg lying in front a tree to stop the chainsaws.)<br>

You can be done under section 69 if you refuse to leave the land (or if you return within 3 months) after police have asked you to, because they 'reasonably believe' you have committed, are committing, or intend to commit section 68.<br>  

During the Whatley Quarry action, one (very small) part of the site was deliberately left working so that people could be arrested for  Aggravated Tresspass - work WAS taking place on the site, even though the work itself wasn't disrupted.

 Coventry Cathedral, this Wednesday, played host to a surreal ceremony, celebrating 100 years of the largest pollution-puffing, congestion-causing invention of all time. <br> The industry's big bosses and minor VIPs  who turned up for the service were subjected to the choking fumes of a Coventry Daimler driven down the aisle - and a sermon from the reverend, starting with him asking for God's forgiveness for "environmental pollution from exhaust fumes, the relentless encroachment of new roads into our countryside and the appalling toll of death and injury".  All of this before the roads protesters, who were there to sab the event, did a thing. <p>

"They shouldn't be holding a religious ceremony about a piece of machinery.""
				A mother whose son was killed in a car crash. <p>

One protester, Angel, went to the front of the Cathedral naked and said "In the spirit of Lady Godiva, I'm here to mourn the death of my mother and the 17 million people killed directly by the motor car,".  She managed to have quite a long rant at the assembled car worshippers before being taken away and arrested under section 2 of the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act, 1860.  This is basically disorderly conduct in a church (unlike blessing a Peugeot after driving it through the church). <p>

Relative to earnings, a car now costs a third of what it did  in 1960. What ever happened to the Tory belief in the "polluter pays" approach to cleaning up the environment? Obviously it has been abandoned, as it would cost the Tories the earth, or at least, so they believe, a car showroom-full of Middle England seats come the election.  <p>

TESTING TIME - The first national mass DNA testing has been announced by the Government. All drivers of white Mercedes lorries are to be asked for - or forced to give - samples in a bid to catch the murderer of a French student. Concentrated testing in regions has taken place before. In a Cardiff murder case last year anyone who refused was instantly considered a suspect  and therefore compulsory tested under - yes, you've guessed it - the Criminal Justice Act. So far the police are estimated to have 135,000 people on the world's first database since it was set up less than a year ago. <br>*** <p>According to a headline in Construction News this week - "Newbury Bypass may be Scrapped!".  It's nice to know what those in the industry think about it all eh?<br> ***<p> On January the 4th every year, the Ogoni of Nigeria mark Ogoni day.  This year on Ogoni day, military opened fire on a procession of people, killing six, injuring more and making a dozen or so arrests.
