Landlords left court with Criminal Justice Act egg on the face on Monday when an eviction using the new squatting laws was thrown out of court. In  late August landlords were given an extra legal tool which which to evict squatters.  However Monday's hearing brought by the Bristol Church Housing Association to evict two homeless people goes back to court this coming Monday -  where the Christians could face a judical review, which would take up to a year!  <br>A jubilant spokesperson from the Advisory Service for Squatters (ASS) told SchNEWS  "I think we're gonna have a few of these".  Locally there is a huge campaign with shops and houses covered in posters slagging off the Trust and supporting  the squatters. The ASS added : "The Bristol Church are well in the shit and deserve everything thats coming to them. <p>
So, no score on the arrestometer  yet... just a big minus for landlords .<br>  <br>REMEMBER: squatting is still legal !  A new issue of the Squatters Handbook will be out from late October. 2 St Pauls Road, London, N1 2QN.<p>  <center><b>0171 359 8814.</b></center><p>
The Housing Information Project (HIP) have organised a celebration action event to mark the 20th anniversary of the famous Elgin Avenue squatters' victory and other housing successes in the mid seventies.  It will include exhibitions, films, discussions at WECH Community Centre, Elgin Avenue, Harrow Road, W9, noon till 7pm <p><center><b>(0171 277 7639).</b></center><br>  They've also produced an action pack on the new laws: <br>20p + SAE to 612 Old Kent Road, London SE15 1JB.

Last Tuesday Maragret Jones and Richard Lloyd became the first in the country to be charged under the new  'trespassory assembly' sections of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA).  They were arrrested in June whilst outside Stonehenge on a vigil commerorating ten years since the Battle of the Beanfield, (when riot police trashed travellers and their vehicles to stop the Stonehenge Free Festival, carrying out the largest mass arrest of civilians for hundreds of years - see SchNEWS 25). <p>The draconian new laws ban gatherings of more than 20 people on private land - the defendants argued that there was only 19 of them .  In court, the policemen and security guards who were called to witness by the prosecution couldn't quite make their minds up how many people were actually there. One said twenty five, one said twenty, and another said twenty one. Then a video was produced in which Margaret Jones was heard clearly to count up to nineteen, (obviously it was a bit much to expect the police to be able to count). <p>But the courts were evidently stinging from the case of Arthur Pendragon, the druid who walked free from a similar charge earlier this month. They talked disparagingly of the gatherers as being "members of the travelling community" and tried to make out Margaret Jones was guilty because she was carrying a sollicitor's phone number around with her that day! At one point, it was even suggested that Margaret was so hysterical she couldn't count. They charged her with �100 costs and Richard with a �400 fine and �100 costs, both suspended pending appeal.<p>
    When we spoke to Margaret, she told us: "We do see this as a political decision and we will fight it as we have to to uphold our right of peaceable assembly." They are even prepared to take it to the European Court. We wish them the best of luck.

The introduction of children's prisons - a particularly nasty bit of the CJA , and that's saying something - suffered another setback on Monday when the Howard League for Penal Reform extracted major concessions from the Home Office. The League agreed to postpone its application for judicial review of the Home Secretary's plans for 'secure training centres' for 12 to 14 years olds after the Home Office promised to implement the standards required in the Children Act when building and operating the proposed centres.<br>
Local authorities and social workers have refused to have anything to do with the new prisons because the idea is so fuckin' stupid, so they are to be built and run - for a profit - by private security firms such as Group 4, Premier Prisons and the Correction Corporation of America (honest!). The Howard League will continue to monitor the government's plans, and try to ensure they do not breach the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. And SchNEWS will continue to keep you posted on how the CJA scapegoats and blames another vulnerable group for society's ills - our children.

Britain once again failed to condemn French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, further fuelling reports that there  is collusion with Chirac over sharing data from the blasts. The second test took place on Fangatuafa Atoll at Midnight last Sunday. <p>The blast, at 110 Kilotonnes was five times stonger than the first test at Muroroa, 
where there are huge cracks in the structure of the Atoll caused by years of nuke tests.
A secret military map uncovered this week reveals cracks up to 5 miles long in the island and that scientific missions to Muroroa as long ago as 1980 believed tests could cause the disintegration of the atoll and the release of radioactivity.<p>  
As the British government stays silent other governments are united in their condemnation  of the tests.  The 16-nation South Pacific Forum, which includes Australia, New Zealand the self-governing Island States, has cut off all communication with the French in protest at the tests.<p>
In Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, heavily reinforced security forces are preventing further rioting by anti-nuclear and independence demonstrators by detaining locals daily and using TV footage of the demonstrations to identify rioters (sound familiar?) To date about 50 people have been nicked for rioting.

At 11 am on October 18th the people of Holts Field in Swansea are due to be evicted and have their homes demolished - apparently out of spite. The wooden chalets they live in , built before the war, are classifield in law as mobile homes, even though they have never been moved.  The landlowner Tim Jones, has failed to get planning permission to build executive mansions on the site - but wants to trash the homes anyway.<br>
A spokesperson for The Land Is Ours told SchNEWS "45 people live in Holts Field, ranging from a baby to an 80 year old woman.  Many have been there for decades,  their houses are tiny but beautifully built. The community is one of the last places in Britain which truely deserves that term - they all look after each other."
They have sworn to resist the evictions - but can't do it by themselves, especially as most of them have no experience of direct action. So please get down there from the 18th on wards - with D-locks and possibly climbing gear. <p>   <center><b>01792 234027/ 01792 233596  </b></center>

The first people charged under the rave sections of the Criminal justice Act (CJA) are up in court next Thursday (12th October) - and are asking for your  support. Members of the  Black Moon soundsystem  we're nicked  whilst prpearing to play at 'the Mother ' the 'big  free festival of the summer in direct defiance of the CJA.  Whilst alone in a field, they were surrounded by over 30 police officers backed up a helicopeter, and arrested.  Bruno of Black Moon told SchNEWS  "'  If convicted we  could face up to three months in prison and a �2,500 fine - as well as losing our �9 grand rig. All for simply wanting to throw a party in disused field, miles from anywhere.  This is the despotic face of British justice."   Turn up at Corby magistrates Court, Northamptonshire 10 am  and help fight for your right to party. <center><b> 01298 27475</b></center><p>

<p>ID cards are "detrimental to the rights of individual citizens" and should be opposed in "both principal and practice." And those aren't the words of a dysfunctional anarchist oganistion, but the opinions of  local government. They have come out with a blanket rejection to government proposals to introduce any ID card scheme in this country, and therefore given fingers to the Home Secretary Michael Howard. <p>

The attack comes from all the three main local authority associations, all Labour controlled. But it contradicts the message coming from the front bench of the party, who would support a voluntary scheme. The local authorities, however, say that if a voluntary scheme were introduced "there would be substantial social pressure to carry a card. In effect, a voluntary scheme would lead to a de faco compulsory one very quickly." Nice of them to have the foresight.<p>

Other problems that they have highlighted include the exacerbation of tensions that would occur between young people and ethnic minorities and the police if such a scheme was inroduced. They would have to prove their identity more than average, according to their report.<p> 

The so-called "smart card" system  would allow information to be stored on an individual who would have no access to it themselves. As the SchNEWS reported in May, the Government Data Network is already in place, linking up to other major databases such as the Inland Revenue and Social Security, and information could be exchanged between these state agencies. This information, according to the local government, could be " inappropriate, innaccurate, and incapable of being checked." <p>

And, (flippin' 'eck, what's goin' on), there are further allies in the fight against ID cards in the right of the Conservative Party. They have said the cards aould have "very serious implications for the traditional liberties of the British people." But before we all get too complacent,  Electronic Data Systems are a hugh multinational who are set to make a killing if the scheme goes through. They are already bidding for data processing schemes such as the DVLC licences. And we know the government are big mates with big business.........

Come up North where the air is cold and the beer is cheap!! The No M66 camp needs loads of people to help out and join the protest at Daisy Nook, Manchester. Cheerful and positive vibes all round. <p><b>Phone (0161) 371 5433. </b><p> The  Police Complaints Authority have just published a review of  the first weeks' policy for live animal export demonstrations at Brightlingsea.  As you would expect, it was a complete whitewash. Derek Day, one of the 14 people taken to court by animal exporter Roger Mills, who was claiming damages for his trade, was so incensed by the outcome that he told Chief Constable what he thought.  A few moments later he tragically collapsed and died.  Demonstraters later asked Mills that out of a mark of respect he stop live export lorries going thru the village for the day. Mills, speaking on radio, said "protestors have never shown me any respect, so I'm not gonna show them any."  Derek Day's wife is still being sued.<p>Last weeks SchNEWS was told of Mike Roberts, who was refused bail by the police because they thought he was gonna abscond - on account of the fact that cuddly toys were missing from his mantelpiece.  Another Shoreham protestor was in the courts canteen, wearing a glove puppet, much to the amusement of everyone eating - apart from the two coppers who nicked Mike.  The very next day Mr. Glove Puppet Man was nicked, his house searched and charged with "attempting to pervert the cause of justice."<p>The first mass arrests under the CJA in the country have now come to court in Essex. They are being dealt with in a job lot trial this week and next . Thirty-three hunt sabs were arrested in violent clashes with the police - twenty-three charged with aggravated trespass.

Justin Wright  was arrested and charged with assault at Windsor mass Trespass in  Febuary.  He is appealing for witnesses. <br>He's  5 9", well built with a ruddy complexion, and was wearing a black bomber jacket/black jeans and pork-pie type hat. He has longish  mousey-coloured hair down to jaw line. He'd just  put his arm round a woman who was hysterical because her daughter had just been arrested.  As he walked back to Justice?'s double-decker he was pounced on by police.  This is urgent! <p> <b><center>Please ring 01273 699424</center></b><p>

Possession of a vegan chocolate cake! Two hunt sabs had baked a cake in anticipation of their friend being acquitted in court but she lost the case. Feeling it was inappropriate to give her the gift they drove home. On the way police stopped their car for no reason and took the cake to be a bomb (it was in a cake-tin). Of course! They were held for 18 hours on "suspicion of carrying dangerous explosives" while the tin was sent to forensics.

THE FUCK-OFF SHOREHAM CASE: <br>In May Dan Johnson was acquitted from the heinous charge of laughing at a police officer after Brighton magistrates ruled that the men from the Met had lied about him 'spitting' and 'screaming like a lunatic'. A woman close-by had remonstrated with police, (whose identification numbers were concealed).   They (allegedly)  gave her the classic line: "Don't fucking swear or  you'll be arrested". She had then muttered: "This is ridiculous, it's a fucking joke!",whereupon she was promptly nicked for 'threatening and abusive behaviour'. Despite Dan's aquittal, despite the police swearing first, and despite the fact she is 5'3'' and amongst 1,500 riot police she was found guilty this week and fined.
