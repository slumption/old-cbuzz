<h2><A NAME="screwed">SCREWED!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;While we are here let's not forget the ones we left
behind. I stayed up all night talking through the wall last night to a man who
is innocent. But he is buried alive. The list of names is endless. These
people are still where we were this morning; they are still fighting for their
innocence. They have got nothing.&quot;</em><BR>
<strong>- James Robinson, one of the Bridgwater Three.</strong><p>
As the release of the Bridgwater Three after eighteen years wrongful
imprisonment sent shock waves through the judicial system people are asking
could it happen again? The authorities say it couldn't but as Paul Foot, author
of the book <em>"Who Killed Carl Bridgewater"</em> said: <em>&quot;Why has it
taken so long for this grotesque injustice to be righted? the answer is that
the judicial and police authorities are extremely reluctant to admit it is
possible that their procedures can go terribly wrong.&quot;</em><p>
With 60,000 prisoners in the UK - and rising (that's one in every
thousand) - more miscarriages are likely to occur. <EM>Justice</EM>, the legal human rights
organisation, estimate each year, some 200 innocent people are sentenced to
lengthy terms of imprisonment. <p>
In fact things could be getting worse. The recent Criminal Procedure and
Investigation Act approved rules to limit defence access to material, unless
the police or prosecution say that it is relevant. And yesterday (Thursday)
Home Secretary Michael Howard published 33 recommendations in <em>Review of the
Criminal Justice System</em>, further limiting the right for a trial by jury
for certain offences. Already public order offences such as obstruction of the
highway and the use of threatening or abusive behaviour do not carry the right
to jury trial.
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading3">Rough Justice</A></h3>

<strong></strong><em>&quot;Those of you who have never been in prison cannot
know the unbearable pain of separation from the world and from those you love,
the terrible, dehumanising monotony of prison routine, and the feeling that every
day spent inside is a day stolen from my life.&quot;</em><BR>
<strong>- Raphael Rowe, one of the M25 Three.</strong><p>

In 1988 Raphael Rowe, Michael Davis and Randolph Johnson were found
guilty of the `M25 Murder'. During the trial even the judge said
&quot;So much of the evidence is itself tainted for one reason or
another, and there is considerable uncertainty and inconsistency in
important areas&quot;. Such as the fact that police were looking for
three men, two of whom were white, one with fair hair and blue eyes -
while those convicted are all black! <em>M25 campaign, 28 Grimsell
Park, Camberwell, London SE5 OTB. Phone 0171 735 2985.</em><p>

KENNY CARTER was nearing the end of a short sentence for robbery when he was
accused of murdering a cellmate - who tragically had hung himself in the night.
Despite no forensic or fingerprint evidence, or evidence of a forced hanging, he
was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. <em>HMP
Belmarsh, Western Way, Thamesmead, London, SE28 OEB</em><p>

JOSEPHINE SMITH was convicted of murdering her husband in 1993. The court had
heard evidence of how she had suffered many years of emotional, physical and
sexual abuse. Her plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished
responsibility was rejected by the judge who recommend a 12 year sentence. She
said <em>&quot;I killed him to get away safely, to get the children away safely
with no fear of him coming after me.&quot;</em> <em>Justice for Women, 55
Rathcool Gardens, London N8 9NE </em><p>

Prison life is extremely boring, so letters are generally the highlight of the
day. Don't know what to say? Talk about your life, things you are up to - just
be careful not to say anything that will get anyone into trouble. Most prisons
do not allow letters in without a return address. Some get stopped, read,
&quot;diverted&quot; and &quot;lost&quot; so it's often worth sending the
first letter via recorded delivery as these have to be opened in the prisoner's
presence. Most prisoners are not the &quot;mad beasts&quot; portrayed by the
tabloids, they are ordinary people, and the only way they are going to know you
support them is to tell them so <strong>GET WRITING</strong>.<p>

KIT WILSON (involved in anti-road protests) is being held on remand at KG 3464,
HMP Bullingdon, Patrickhaugh Rd., Arncot, Bicester OX6 OPZ He's to appear in
Reading court on 20th March charged with affray, a charge disputed
even by two
security guards from Fairmile. On the 17th he will appear at Weymouth
Magistrates Court for obstruction charges. He'd appreciate messages of support
and people to turn up at his court cases.
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading4">The Bench Bunch</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>A 1984 survey of 150 Stockport Magistrates revealed an average
age of 53 dealing with offenders over half of whom were under 21. The reason
for the imbalance lies partly in the voluntary nature of the service, which can
attract Ladies Bountiful with time on their hands and deter workers whose
employers are reluctant to give them time off for magisterial duties. Selection
procedures have also been to blame. The names of members of local advisory
committees are keep secret in order to protect them from lobbying, which simply
means they are lobbied by those &quot;in the know&quot;. (There are several
examples of undue influence by organisation like the Freemasons or Rotary). Too
much attention has in the past been paid to recruitment from local political
parties, business organisations and charities, and too little to the claims of
welfare and minority groups. For example, in 1988 there were just 455 (1.9%) black
Magistrates.<p>
<h2>Women</h2>
Women are more likely to be convicted of 'crimes of poverty' unconnected with
violent crime, and more likely than men to be imprisoned. Most women in prison
are in for fine default for a non-prisonable offence. Women are 68% of people
convicted of not having a TV licence, and 1/3 of women imprisoned for
non-payment of fines in 1994 were convicted of prostitution offences. 70% of
convictions for theft committed by women are for amounts less than &#163;50.<p>

The <em>Tommorow's People Trust</em> is not part of the tacky '70s sci-fi TV series
about teenage telepaths, but Grand Metropolitan's vehicle for Workfare. Its
London HQ was invaded by claimants this week; pissed off at its involvement in
<em>Project Work</em> slave labour pilot schemes - the work for dole scheme coming your
way soon. <p>
Thirty people occupied the building, with one cop trying for <em>Crap Arrest of the
Week</em>, when he threatened to nick the owner of the banners for criminal
damage to the windows (caused by the tape sticking them up!) After being
ejected from the building, they leafleted GM staff and passers
by. Thay said: &quot;Any
firm, charity or council involved in Project Work can expect to be targeted by
angry claimants. <em>With this occupation we warn any company thinking of
getting involved in Project Work: think again.&quot; </em>More Project
Work pilot schemes
are starting at the end of March, including one here in Brighton.<p>
Groundswell has called a National Day of Action against Project Work for 2nd April.<p>
<UL>
<LI>Remember those Job Seekers Allowance directives telling people they could be
ordered to smarten up/get their hair cut or face losing their benefit? One
claimant decided to complain using the `Telling us about it' forms available
from all DSS buildings, after being told he was scruffy. The Customer Services
Manager for Brighton benefits agency responded <em>&quot;I am sorry if you
were offended when a member of staff commented on your appearance. Obviously,
appearance is each individual person's choice and I am sure the comments were
only meant to be constructive.&quot;</em> It's good to moan.

A 12 year campaign against the Euro-tourist highway that
will carve through the Pyrenees destroying the last habitat of the <strong>European
Brown Bear</strong> is soon to erupt into what promises to be a spectacular eviction of
an impressive mountainside anti-road camp. Six empty cottages along the route
are available and needing to be barricaded, and help is needed to defend to
original camp. The region is too beautiful to be destroyed without resistance,
the eviction is expected on March 15th, for information Tel: 00 33 593 47883, or
the Justice? office and leave a message for Gwen.
<LI>For some time in the small provincial town of Radomsko in <strong>Poland</strong>, numerous
groups of fascists, had been terrorising local young people. Violent attacks by
these boneheads on those who were `different' became an everyday occurrence.
Things got so bad that some people decided to fight back - resulting in the
death of a fascist. Seventeen anti-fascists were then arrested, 13 of whom are
still in prison. Their families are having difficulty financing an adequate
legal defence, so if your feeling flushed send donations to the defence fund

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>A recent technological breakthrough has meant that scientists
have managed to genetically clone a sheep. The genetic reconstruction of
embryos, which are then surgically placed in surrogate mothers, means that
sheep can be genetically cloned and duplicated. `Dolly', derived simply from
the adult ewe udder cell, has provoked questioning of the ethics of genetic
engineering and cloning. And as Mark Little at the recent `Have I Got SchNEWS
for you?' show asked, 'Why do they want to clone sheep, they all look the
bloody same anyway!'<p>

<strong></strong>Last Wednesday in Newcastle 60 people stopped a nuclear
warhead convoy travelling to Faslane submarine base in Scotland. The protesters
performed a surprise two-pronged attack on the convoy meaning, as one officer
said, <em>&quot;You caught us with our trousers down&quot;</em>. Quick setting
concrete was tipped over the windscreen of the first truck, locked-on on top
and underneath of the convoy and one person claimed to have damaged the chassis
of one of the trucks - holding up the convoy for well over 2 hours. More info
