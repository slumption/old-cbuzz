<strong>As Tarmac starts building Britian's first childrens prison 
in Kent, SchNEWS says</strong>

<H2>'PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE, JACK!'</H2>


Children's prisons for 12 to 14 year olds, one of the most horrific
provisions of the Criminal Justice Act and the only part of the Act
that Michael Howard was unable to implement, have been given the go
ahead by Home Secretary Jack Straw. In a complete about turn, Tarmac
have started building the first of these prisons at Cookham Wood in
Kent.<P>

Tony 'say-what-you-mean-and-mean-what-you-say' Blair, speaking before
the election, described the idea of these prisons as 'short-sighted
beyond belief'. Now New Labour has decided it wants to build them
after all. If they are stopped, it will be a real kick in the teeth
for the get-nasty politics that New Labour seems so keen on shoving
down our throats at every opportunity.<P>

The prisons are to be run by those well known experts in helping
disturbed children, Group 4. In the last few days of the Tory
government, Michael Howard rushed through enormously lucrative
contracts with Tarmac and Group 4 to build and run the prisons (keep
an eye out for any well-paid directorships coming Micky's way in a few
years time).<P>

Labour could easily have told Group 4 where to go with their contract,
especially given how much prison work Group 4 are after from the
government, but no. Instead, Jack Straw wants to spend an estimated
�4-5,000 per week per child running barbaric regimes that will be
totally ineffective in reducing crime.<P>

Children locked up in these prisons will not even have the protection,
little as it is in practice, that children kept in local authority
care have. The Children Act - which gives children in care rights to
visits, phone calls, access to independent inspectors and so on - will
not apply to the STCs.<P>

Fran Russell of the Howard League for Penal Reform told SchNews,
"These child jails, apart from being repugnant, will simply not
work. Putting vulnerable, disturbed children hundreds of miles from
their families and communities is no way to get children to stop
offending. The only similar place for children in this age range in
the UK is at Lisnevin in Northern Ireland and the reoffending rate
there is 100%.  <em>"The whole point of these jails is to demonise
children, to make out that small children are a threat to society who
need to be banished as far away as possible. Inevitably, there will be
bullying, self-harming and suicides in these institutions and the
children will come out more likely to offend than when they went
in. We hoped we'd got over all this when Michael Howard went - but
this Home Secretary seems just as keen as his predecessor to portray
children as evil and dangerous." </em><P>

There are plans to build five Secure Training Centres across the
country. Apart from Cookham Wood (which, incidentally, is located in
the small town of Borstal, which gave its name to locking up kids
years ago) they want to build them in Onley in Northamptonshire,
Medomsley in Co. Durham, Gringley-on-the-Hill in Nottinghamshire and
at another at an as yet undisclosed location. The discerning eye may
notice that these are not exactly large cities, where the children are
expected to come from. No - they are, in fact, miles from anywhere.<P>

Given that maintaining family connections is probably the most
important thing for any child in care or custody one could ask -
what's going on? A fair question if you believed that building these
mini-Strangeways had anything to do with helping kids or even stopping
crime. But, of course, they don't - it's all about acting tough to win
over middle England's hearts and votes. And if a few kids get
brutalised, abused and set on a life of crime as a result - well,
that's a price any New Labour politician would find well worth paying.<P>

Already there has been a successful local campaign to hold up the
building of one of these prisons, at Gringley-on-the-Hill. Tom
Crowther of the campaign told SchNews, <em>"To be honest, it started off
because we didn't want one in our village. But the more we got into it
we went from not wanting one here to not wanting any at all. Our
village has a population of 400 and one bus a day. They're expecting
to sent kids to us from Liverpool, which is 100 miles away, and from
Birmingham, which is five hours away by public transport. It just
doesn't make sense - how are mothers with other kids going to be able
to visit their children in these places? You have to wonder what it's
all about."</em> The campaign at Gringley has led to planning permission
being refused and a public enquiry being set up.<P>

Michael Howard tried for years to get children's prisons built - and
failed. New Labour act as if they can get away with anything at the
moment, from 'ethically' selling Indonesia Hawk jets to finally
abolishing free higher education. Now they want to lock up kids
hundreds of miles from their homes just to show how 'tough on crime'
they are. There is no reason why they should be allowed to succeed.<P>

<LI>A London Animal Rights activist was recently nicked while
protesting outside a gun shop for possession of an 'offensive weapon'
- yes, you've guessed it - a dreaded bicycle lock! He was eventually
released without charge.

<LI>For skateboarding! Two men were nicked for the heinous crime of
skating along a path at Derby's Market Place Square. One of them
received an �80 fine and the other is still awaiting trial.

<LI>(not quite, but nearly) A girl picking up litter at a free party
by Krunch sound system in Cambridgeshire was threatened with arrest if
she carried on clearing up the rubbish!

<H2>Hasta La Vista Zapatista </H2>

<small><em>(Not really... We just said this cos it rhymes) ...</em></small><P>

  <EM>"The voices
and words are like many springs of life, water in a world being
scorched by greed, cruelty and neo-liberalism.  We have begun to dig
the channels for the water to flow amongst themselves so it may reach
all corners of the planet."</EM> <strong>- Zernep, Turkey</strong><P>

In the killer heat, amongst the giant mosquitoes of El Indiano, the
conference in a squatted farm begins.  Meanwhile in a Spanish
bullring, two masked Mexicans take to the stage. In an intoxicating
atmosphere, these representatives of the Zapatista rebel army are
given an ecstatic welcome. This is Plaza de Toros, in a rundown
district of Madrid, and the inauguration ceremony of the Second
Intergalactic Encuentro for Humanity and Against Neo-Liberalism (!).
More than 3,000 people have travelled from over 60 countries for nine
days across Spain to create a 'network of resistance'.<P>

The sheer scale and concept of this remarkable conference is difficult
to describe. With such a multilingual gathering of tribes, translation
itself is a key problem.  But, it is said, "we speak many languages,
but ours is the language of Utopia". It is a gathering of people "who
dared to dream"- an open, embracing encounter for the oppressed people
of the world. And the oppressed people of the world are having one
helluva Fiesta!"  We are here to discuss how the current economic
policies are affecting our everyday lives all over the world," says
Lucia, eyes twinkling above the red scarf disguising her identity.
"We need to find a way of creating a global network of organisations
that have the power to resist these economic polices."<P>

The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) came out of the
jungle on New Year's Day 1994 to occupy six towns in Mexico, taking
their name from the unfinished revolution of 1910 led by Emile Zapata,
and inspiring those fighting for a better world.  Or as Andrew from
Ireland told SchNEWS "It came after the fall of Communism, the Gulf
War and general feeling of helplessness. This was a new struggle. It
become a focus of the left as a successful movement, free from labels
such as Marxist."<P>

This Encuentro is unparalleled. Like a global DiY conference, there is
no top-down organisational structure and the people are from poor,
unfunded groups.  "This movement is about hope," says Lucia.  "In this
world hope has gone down, down, down....but now our heart exists and
we are gonna get together and empower ourselves and go to the streets
and say to everybody we exist."  The South American Movimento Sem
Terra (the landless Brazilians) are here.  So too are 120 Mexicans,
who have raised the equivalent of three months wages each to fly in,
and twenty-five indigenous people, who have had their flights paid
from Colombia, Chile and Argentina. Squats, schools and sports halls
accommodate the masses in a staggering feat of hectic organisation.
<P>

The Encuentro has also been swamped by 800 activists from Italy,
adding a dash of style and techno know-how.  "The Zapatistas have
given a shake to the revitalised left in Italy," explains Maloop from
the Centro Sociale Occupato Autogestito Forte Prenestino (got
that?). In June, four thousand Italians had descended on Milan train
station and demanded transport to join the march against the Euro
Summit in Amsterdam. After eight hours of deadlock they got their
way. He adds, "After this we are very strong."  This is a gathering
conducted in a truly epic style. From the first meeting place in
Madrid, the participants were spread liberally around the Spanish
state.  Six tables, or sub-conferences, were arranged by theme and
situated as far apart as El Indian on the South coast to Barcelona in
the east coast.  In something as ambitiously broad and
all-encompassing as a gathering "against neo-liberalism", the
descriptions of the various themes give concrete focus for discussion.
Culture, education, information, land rights, ecology, labour...in all
25 sub-themes. One of the well attended tables is on patriarchy -
reflecting an awareness of women's issues in the EZLN itself, an army
comprised of more than a third women.  <P>

Regular communications arrive via the Internet from Chiapas, a medium
without which perhaps the Encuentro wouldn't exist. But it's not all
talk. The police pulled out of evicting the Vakeria squat ('Cow shed')
in Barcelona on Tuesday night when they realised an international
force of 1,000 activists would march to the building's defence."  The
most impressive thing is that rather than being overwhelmed by the
number of people here, and all the cultural and political differences,
everyone is really getting down to it", says Richard from Cambridge.
"The sense of purpose found here will spread back across the world.
It brings a new meaning to the word globalisation."<P>

<h2>RTZ In The Dock</h2>

Bad news for our earthrapist friends at RTZ - the Law Lords ruled last
week that the British-based multinational mining corporation can be
sued in UK courts for the activities of one of their subsidiaries in
Namibia.  The implications of this ruling are far-reaching - and most
encouraging.  It means that third world victims of the subsidiaries of
other British multinationals should be able to sue the parent company,
and even get Legal Aid to do so.  Shell Oil, this means you. PARTIZANS

<h2>and finally</h2> 

SchNEWS just has to share 2 stories printed in Wednesday's Guardian
Diary column -'<P>
 On Humberside, a savage attack has been made upon the
Freemasons. Former policeman Stuart Brash told a gospel meeting that
he was a Mason "until he realised it was Devil-led", the Grimbsy
Evening Telegraph reports. Mr.Brash then revealed that "he quit the
police force when he became
 a Christian, after he realised he could not continue lying 
to help obtain criminal convictions".<P>

Meanwhile 'Serving officers are asked to come to the aid of 
Julian Clary. Police Review magazine 
reports that Mr. Clary is "said to be disappointed with his 
response to his quest for Britain's most 
beautiful bobby." Only 25 snaps have been sent to his show, 
All Rise for Julian Clary, and it just 
won't do."<P>
