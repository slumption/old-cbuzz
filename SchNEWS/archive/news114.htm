<A NAME="rank">Rank Stink!</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Over a thousand acres of officially `protected' forest and
farmland in East Kent are under threat from a huge development proposal by the
Rank Organisation. The `Oasis Holiday <em>Village'</em> - the size of a
<strong>small town</strong> - will have 350 waterside villas, 400 forest
lodges, 78 studio apartments, a large village centre with shops, country club,
`sub tropical waterworld', 9 hole golf course, a rubber lined artificial lake,
parking for 3,400 cars and, of course, lots more roads. All this in part of the
ancient Lyminge Forest in the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
<p>
Some people, however, aren't exactly over the moon about this and have set up
camp. &quot;The Rank Organisation is one of the largest holiday and leisure
companies in Europe, and part of its corporate development plan includes
breaking into the UK's `Artificial Village in a Forest' self-catering holiday
market, currently dominated by Centre Parcs. The newly appointed Chairman,
ex-ICI boss Sir Denys Henderson (also currently a director of both Barclays'
Bank and Rio Tinto Zinc) is determined to out-do Centre Parcs with bigger and
better &quot;oasis Villages' in more of the most beautiful and sensitive parts
of the English countryside. We have been warned.&quot;<p>
Unlike Centre Parcs*, who prefer to build their resorts on bare land - on which
they spend around &#163;1 million per site planting trees - Rank has opted to
take advantage of the government's ongoing national asset-strip, which obliges
the Forestry Commission to sell land whenever possible. Public land is being
sold to a private developer for  around 4 million.<p>
If the West Wood development goes ahead, it will also worsen East Kent's
already severe water shortage: the artificial lake will require an initial
input of 17.5 million gallons, with an estimated daily consumption of 320,000
gallons for the `village' as a whole.<p>
Despite all this, Shepway District Council <strong>invited</strong> Rank to
develop West Wood after `balancing the needs of the countryside with the needs
of jobs being created.'<p>
Rank seem very sensitive to bad publicity. When SchNEWS rang for a wee chat, we
got a curt &quot;no comment&quot; to our very polite questioning. Maybe you can
do better?  Call Julie Gould, Oasis Villages Ltd's Communications Officer 01293
658658.<strong> </strong> Be persistent.<p>
Meanwhile, the Forestry Commission (who still own the land protesters are
camped on) told SchNEWS, &quot;We are not planning to evict at present, we are
just monitoring the situation.&quot; Maybe something to do with the
&#163;20,000 it 'll cost to take  campers to the High Court? <p>
So, if housing benefit cuts are making life unbearable and you fancy some of
that countryside fresh air stuff, why not join the camp in West Wood?  Contact
Flat Oak on <strong>01227 261057</strong><p>
Rank subsidiaries:  Odeon cinemas, Mecca and Top Rank Bingo, Rank Amusements,
Associated Leisure, Hard Rock Cafes, Butlin's, Shearings and Warner Holidays.
Anyone fancy hitting these venues with leaflets?<p>

<A NAME="crap">Crap Arrest of the Week</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>For not using a toilet. A Manchester Airport activist was
charged with criminal damage for emptying the contents of his large intestine
onto a piece of security fence. He was apprehended two days after the act after
being caught on video surveillance. At least he didn't use the Section 6 to
wipe with!

<A NAME="csgas">CS Gas vs Pepper Spray</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Herts Police Force are working on a synthetic version of
pepper spray, the incapacitant used in the US. Chief Constable Peter Sharpe,
worried about the effects of CS on their officers, said the research was
important because &quot;we can do better than what we've got at the
moment&quot;. There have been at least 61 deaths by pepper spray in the US
since 1990. Risks include gene mutation, cancer, toxicity of the major body
organs and possible human fatalities.<p>
&quot;There has always been an element of cross-contamination from CS. We have
always preferred pepper spray, but for  some reason the Home Secretary just
blanked out the idea of pepper spray trials.&quot; P'haps he hasn't heard that
it can be fatal...<p>

<LI>In the annual round of issuing the Old Bill with more gizmos and gadgets,
Kent officers must be chuffed with their latest acquisition...whistles. Sgt.
Mark Pearson explained, &quot;It's assertive policing. We won't accept someone
being abusive in the street or hanging around drinking alcohol. So we whistle
at them...&quot; (OK, we made that last bit up!)

<A NAME="drax">Dirty Drax</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Feeling secure in the knowledge that there's only about half
an hours worth of natural oil reserves left, it's good to note that Drax Power
Station (between York and Leeds) is starting trials of a new fuel. Petcoke is
produced from the residue left over when all the useful chemicals have been
extracted from oil. It is high in several heavy metals, many of which are
cancer-inducing. Lovely. Info BREACH 01405 769375

<A NAME="airport">Mumbo-Jumbo</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>&quot;The amount of tax-free fuel a typical uncatalysed Boeing
747 Jumbo carries could drive a catalysed family car round the world 60
times.&quot;<p>
- <strong><em>The Guardian</em> </strong><p>
<strong> </strong>Air transport is the most unsustainable form of travel,
wreaking immense damage on the ozone layer. A recent study in <em>Town &amp;
Country Planning</em> magazine estimated that a single transatlantic return
flight  emits almost half the yearly CO2 emissions of the average person as
from all other sources, such as lighting, heating, etc. The amount of carbon
dioxide used is the same used by the average African <em>in a lifetime.</em><p>
<em></em>Yet, in the ceaseless quest for higher profits at any cost, Manchester
Airport have decided to build a second runway - causing more traffic through
the town and more pollution over the heads of local residents, and destroying a
thousand acres of greenbelt.<p>
The DoT forecast that up to 163% more passengers will be using airports by the
year 2010. And that's a Conservative, sorry, <em>conservative</em>  estimate.<p>
In this funny handshake world of ours, SchNEWS has discovered that there are
very close links between Manchester Airport Plc. and the Labour controlled
council. The Chair of the Airport's Board, Graham Stringer, was - until
recently - head of the City Council. <p>
&quot;...In the past, he has denounced environmental protesters in the city on
many occasions. To say that he is a power crazy, ecocidal bastard is an
understatement.&quot; said one Manchester Earth First! activist.<p>
The first camp to be set up was Flywood, quickly followed by six others,
including Wild Garlic, Zion Tree and Cliff Richard (where Swampy lives - who
this week April Fooled the press by announcing that he was standing for
Parliament as a 'Never Mind the Ballots' candidate<em>!)</em> <p>
Supporters of the airport say that it will create lots of jobs. In 1991,
Manchester Airport claimed that the new development would create 50,000 new
jobs. By 1995 this figure was reduced to 18,700; and by the time the Public
Enquiry was held this was down to 8-9,000. In February, Manchester Area Chamber
of Commerce estimated it to be merely 5,000. Many of these are going to be low
paid, short term `McJobs' anyway. How much money per job is that, I hear you
cry? Manchester City Council estimate that it will cost &#163;76,464 to sustain
a job at the airport each year, compared to &#163;26,913 for one in education.
<p>
The Airport is also supposed to create jobs for local people. However, the
local Wythenshawe estate has a 30% unemployment rate, but less than 10% of the
airport's employees come from there. <p>
But it's not just Manchester that is a cause for concern. The DoT have forecast
a 300% increase in air traffic in the South East, a situation even worse than
that faced in Manchester.  Gatwick is being hyped as the new premier base for
British Airways, which will mean despoliation of huge tracts of Surrey and
Sussex. There is little doubt that the Manchurian protests will not be the last
around this issue. <p>
Deregulation of air transport industry is in the offing, which could well mean
even more flights to more places by more earth destroying consumers for less
money. The aviation industry is <em>planely</em>  disgraceful. These
<em>air-soles</em>  need teaching a lesson, just as the dastardly roadbuilders
have been. Muttley, do something!

<strong></strong>Fancy a break but wanna do something useful? Then why not take
a trip to the Sunseed Trust. Based in beautiful surroundings in southern Spain,
the village is an experiment in sustainable lifestyles - everything from
ultra-low cost solar cookers, organic gardening, dry land reclamation, compost
toilets, hydroponics - and good company. It's about &#163;60 a week and you'll
be expected to work four hours a day in the week, but it includes food + board.
Highly recommended. More info 97B Divinity Rd., Oxford, OX4 1LN  Tel 01865
