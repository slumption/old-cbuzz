<p>It promises to be one of the most bizarre court cases of the year - and potentially a test-case for the new 24hrs-to-get-out or face jail laws under the Criminal Justice Act.<p>A community of travellers and homeless people moved into St. Annes Convent, a disused 100-room Nunnery, and have set up a creche, a gallery, a meditation room, rehearsal spaces and meeting rooms for a host of local groups. But hopes to turn it into Britain's biggest commune has been thwarted by a Order of Catholic nuns who are taking the squatters to the High Court. <p>Many local people have joined the fight. Donations of food, furniture, clothing, toys and money have been coming in from neighbours in Hove (actually). Even the local rag is praising the initiative as "well organised" and "effective". This summer the squatters had been forcefully evicted from seafront arches and had launched 'Operation Crusty' to commandeer the derelict West Pier to highlight their plight. High-profile occupations of the Milkmaid Pavilion, the Putting Green and Bedford Square were shortlived before the move to St Anne's Convent.<p>However, the sisters, known as the Poor Servants of the Mother of God, who have recently sold property to boxer Chris Eubank, have issued the summons for repossession. And one local rent-a-gob councillor has even called on nearby schoolgirls to mount "a St Trinian's style attack brandishing hockey sticks" to get them out.<p><center>***Transport is available to go to the High Court.

<a name=ARTICLE2><HR width=80% size=3><H3><center>THE COURTHOUSE - ONE YEAR ON</center></H3><p>
The Courthouse, which was opened last year by Justice? as a squatted community centre in Brighton, is falling down. Our on-the-spot SchNEWS reporter discovered that the US owners, Alford Developments, have left the 100-year-old former magistrates court to rot. A third of the building is flooded with severe water damage.<p>On Tuesday, the day of the anniversary, extra security were drafted in and a police van stood nearby - some officers checking out under cars for bombs! It seems the planning application to demolish the Grade II listed building and build more offices and car parks (decision postponed to Oct 10th) - even if rejected - could be pointless. Only English Heritage have a legal right to enter the building - <b>let's hope they prosecute for criminal neglect.</b>
<p>

<a name=ARTICLE3><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>COOLTAN MOVES ON</H3></center><p>Sadness and melancholy thoughts all round as London's most vibrant  and celebrated squat, CoolTan, move out after three years this Sunday. Named after a sun cream lotion, the Brixton Collective housed the Freedom Network - who got much of the anti-CJA ball rolling - and a million wonderful projects in the former dole office where John Major used to sign on. <p>The Voice newspaper move in from next door on Monday and may well find some party heads emerging into the newsroom days later after Saturdays final blow-out bash (" 'scuse me, d'ya know where the bogs are mate"). Go pay your respects if you are in the area. SchNEWS sends warm wishes and best hopes to all who've been involved. Watch out for Greenland!

<center><H3>SQUATTERS RE-OPEN ABANDONED CINEMA</H3></center><p>

With headlines like 'Carry on Squatting' you could be forgiven for thinking you we're reading The SchNEWS but believe it not these were the words from the Camden Journal!
Squatters moved in to the popular art-deco gem in the centre of Camden Town four weeks ago.  The building  has been empty for the past three years since it was acquired by a property subsiduary of Lohnro and is now falling into disrepair due to neglect. <p> 
A "person unknown" told Schnews: "We have won the support of   the local council, community, traders, taxi firms, fire brigade -even the police !"<p>  
The squatters are also in dialogue with the 'Friends of Parkway' lobby group, which is chaired by Michael "Monty Python" Palin. In fact, support has been so strong that the local bobby even wished the occupier and persons unknown good luck on their way to the latest court case. <p>
And if the owners succeed in evicting everybody? A Planning Officer has assured the squatters the cinema will stand empty for another four years, with possible demolition after that. The next court case is Friday 29th. Meanwhile, enjoy all-night cinema and ambient chill-out cafe every Sat.

<p>Footie Fans have made a bold bid to knock the Hunt Sabs off their long running   number one spot on the Arrestometer.  SchNEWS has learned that since the CJA came into force in November Liverpool Police have arrested 68 people under Section 166.  This clause makes it a criminal offence to sell on a match ticket, even if its at cost price!  .  Of those arrested 49 were prosecuted. Mike from Football Fans Against the CJA told SchNEWS " arrests in football have been going down for some time - it seems only under the CJA  is there a growth area."

<a name=ARTICLE6><HR width=80% size=3><H3><center>GET HIP!</center></H3><p>
 On the 15th October the Housing Information Project (H.I.P.) have organised a celebration action event to mark the 20th anniversary of the famous Elgin Avenue  squatters victory (a row of houses that successfully resisted eviction by the GLC for 2 years using barricades and the like evenutually winning the right to be rehoused.)  and other housing success in the mid seventies.<br>  <center>It will include exhibitions, films and discussions at:<br> <b>WECH Community Centre, Elgin Avenue, Harrow Road, W9  12 noon till 7 pm.  0171 277 7639.</b> <p> They've also  produced an action pack on the new laws: <br> 20p + SAE to <b>612 Old Kent Rd., London, SE15 1JB.</b> </center>

<center><a name=schnewsinbrief><HR width=80% size=3><b>SchNEWS IN BRIEF</b></a> <p>*** A Great Northern Land Action is being planned for late September with the location kept secret till the day.  Be prepared to party with a chance to reclaim the land from some nasty earth rapists. 0113 262 9365 <p>*** SchNEWS has heard that 2 people have been nicked under Section 51 of the CJA 'Intimidation of witnesses + jurors'  by Liverpool Police.  Details are sketchy but we'll let you know if we find out more <p>***  Plans to build a golf course and industrial park in an ecological reserve in Mexico have come a cropper.   Residents occupied the town hall, seized hostages, pelted riot police with stones and blocked streets with barbed wire in a 12 day protest.  Hostages were released in exchange for the resignation of the major!  Developers have said their plans remain unchanged but the new seven-member council which replaced  the mayor said they would revoke the planning licences <p>*** The Green Party and Friends of the Earth are trying to get  a Road Traffic Reduction Bill onto  the statue books.  This would cut 1990 traffic levels by 10% by promoting public transport and other alternatives, curtailing car-centred out-of-town developments and, if necessary, an increase in petrol prices. 0171 242 4474  <p>*** Those On the case people at Road Alert!  have a new campaign round-up out for those of  you want to know where all the road protest action is happening 01635 521770 <p>*** The Blue Route Action Group we're evicted from their last squat on Tuesday after seven hours of resistence. However its not all doom and gloom, one Blue Router told SchNEWS "Costs of the security fencing alone has cost �1 million and and security is expected to cost  Kent County Council �4million over the three years it will take to construct the road." <p>*** On Saturday a  small protest outside Canterbury jail where the countrys first CJA prisoner (in remand for seven days for breaking bail conditions) resulted in seven more arrests after the usual heavy handedness from those nasty Kent coppers <p>*** 12 people have been nicked for aggravated trespass at the anti-Wells relief road site. No more details yet because some of the protestors have gone to the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow to challenge Somerset Council over this and other plans that contravene their party's national policies. The Wells relief road will take out three Schools and two playgrounds, (so much for the Lib Dem interest in education???). <p>***
Locals in Rochdale have been getting in on the direct action tip - to stop plans for to re open a disused quarry. The company promises 125 lorries a day thundering thru' their estate with  tonnes of stone from Ding Quarry.  Doubtless this will be wisely used on such projects as the M66 were  opposition and protest camps are floruishing 0161 627 4862 <p>*** Home Secretary Michael Howards 'good news tour' reached Radio BMRB in Birmingham last week, but things didn't quite go to plan.  As Howard went on air praising his own policies for cracking down on crime, the front foyer was burgled!  Meanwhile in Plymouth, anti-CJA demonstrators shouted loud and proud and pelted his car with eggs!

SchNEWS received a letter from Phil De Sousa charged with riot at the  Welling demo  "It's an old story but if they'd put as much effort as on us into the murderers of Steven Lawrence et al, his family wouldn't be forced into private prosecutions."    Because of time spent in remand  he's out in a few weeks ."I know how much just a card or letter can brighten up your day, and let you know you're not forgotton."  As A PS :'' Its worth saying that hardly anyone who was properly masked up for the whole riot got caught'' <p>

For shouting at a footie match!  A copper decided to nick a Mansfield Town fan under section 154 of the CJA.  This piece of vague legislation means that if you cause  "alarm or distress'' to others you are committing  an offence punishable by up 6 months in prison!  Another bloke told the arresting copper he was a prat - and was nicked too!  Being a Mansfield steward the club have banned him for six months - which probably means they've now got 5 fans.<p>

You have bashed one district judge, thrown a telephone at another and at a preliminary hearing earlier this year, you rushed towards the bench and for reasons best known to yourself, proceeded to spray me with green paint. Some of it is still visible on my wig and my robe, despite my wife's best endeavours. On that occassion I gave you a chance to purge contempt, but you have shown no remorse whatsoever and even wrote to me boasting of your previous contempts. I am now satisfied that your behaviour was calculated to interfere with the administration of justice." <p>After the incident, Judge Brooks asked officials "What did she have written on her bottom? Happy something I think." The complete message was subsequently discovered to be Happy Birthday.  Muraglia was sentenced to 15 months in jail for contempt.
