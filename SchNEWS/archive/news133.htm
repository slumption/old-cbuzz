<h2>
<A NAME="Heading1">ARREST IN PEACE </A></h2>

<p>
<STRONG>Reenie Beenie Blocked -89 arrested</STRONG><p>
<p>
<EM>" [We will] not permit the sale of arms to regimes that could use them for
internal repression or external aggression..." - </EM><STRONG>Labour Party Manifesto
</STRONG><p>
<p>
Labour's claim to have introduced an `ethical' foreign policy rang hollow on
Monday, when George Robertson, the Defence Secretary, officially opened the
Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition (known as `Reenie Beenie'), at
Farnborough. Just three months after promising not to export arms to repressive
regimes, the Government has decided to continue where the Conservatives left
off, staging an event aimed at marketing arms and welcoming nations notorious
for human rights abuses. Buyers from the Indonesian, Turkish and Chinese armies
- and a host of other countries high on the Amnesty International list of human
rights abusers - attended as official guests of the government. Britain is the
world's second biggest arms dealer, after the United States.<p>
 The opening day saw the biggest mass arrest in Britain since the Poll Tax Riot
as up to 1,000 people took part in a demonstration organised by the Campaign
Against the Arms Trade (CAAT). 89 were nicked, many given bail conditions that
prevent them from attending the COPEX Arms fair in October.  Some were also
charged with "aggravated trespass" (dealing with trespass on land in the open),
despite the whole fair being staged inside a building! At one point all three
main gates were simultaneously blockaded, causing mile-long tailbacks. <p>
 25 anti-arms trade protesters managed to thwart security guarding the
exhibition.  "It was very powerful. People were blocking the path of individual
arms dealers who were being escorted in by the police," said one protester. A
group of Buddhists beat drums for eight hours solidly before being physically
removed from the road by the police. They were not arrested. <p>
Rachel Harford from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) told SchNEWS:
<EM>"Allowing the arms fair to go ahead gives the green light to companies happy
to arm some of the world's most oppressive regimes." </EM><p>
The protesters were joined by Kurdish refuges whose banners condemned Turkish
generals as `war criminals' for suppressing the Kurdish PKK left wing
nationalist movement. Vickers has bid for [sterling]3 billion order for 800
battle tanks, almost certainly for use in the 13 year war with the Kurds, which
has cost more than 22,000 lives. Amnesty accuses Turkey of routinely using
torture, and `disappearances' are commonplace.<p>
 Labour says Britain also has to `honour' existing commitments, so 21,000
export licences to Indonesia are to be left in place, including 500 armoured
vehicles. A third of East Timor's population - 200,000 people - have been
killed by the Indonesian army, with the help of British-made Hawk jets, which
are still on sale.  Big arms dealers in the UK are British Aerospace, GKN, GEC
and Rolls-Royce. The majority of sales go to developing countries, with Saudi
Arabia by far the biggest buyer. The countries which purchase arms invariably
fail to provide rudimentary health care, education or basic necessitates of
life while they squander  limited resources on arms. <p>
<p>

<LI>	On 1st October there will be a mass blockade against COPEX Arms Fair,
Farnborough Airfield, Hampshire. 12 noon - 6pm  CAAT: 0171 281 0297<p>

<A NAME="Heading2">Nuke For Free</A></h2>

<p>
This week, four Greenham women were found not guilty of criminal damage by
Reading Crown Court. Jean Hutchinson, Mary Wilson, Yolanda Kreik and Katrina
Howse were accused of fence cutting - causing an estimated [sterling]37,000 of
damage, at AWE Aldermaston. The Crown Prosecution Sservice retreated from the
case in disarray after realising that the evidence of nuclear crime perpetrated
by AWE Aldermaston was overwhelming. A Greenham peace campaigner told SchNEWS,
"This trial would have revealed that the Trident weapons do not serve the
present deterrent policy of this country, and that both the policy and the
weapons are illegal under national and international law. This case is part of
an on-going challenge of non-violent direct action against nuclear weapons in
Britain by the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp- which celebrates it's
sixteenth birthday on 5th September." Happy Birthday to YOU!<p>
<UL><LI> On 5th Jan, three more women will find themselves in court on a charge of
fence cutting, this time at AWE Burghfield. These court cases form part of the
Greenham Women's Millennium initiative to outlaw all nuclear weapons by the
year 2000. <STRONG>Contact the Peace Camp on: 01635 269109</STRONG><p>

<A NAME="worthingcm">It Was (yet) Another Road Death</A></h2>

<p>
Worthing's Critical Mass, which has been scheduled for this weekend, has been
postponed until Saturday September 20th.  Apparently an ex-member of the Royal
Family died last weekend, and the whole country is going to grind to a halt on
Saturday anyway.  Ironically, the Critical Mass was called to commemorate
another road death, that of Danni Parke, age 29, a local green activist who was
killed under the wheels of a lorry while cycling home from work last Wednesday.
<p>
                 Within 24 hours friends had decided to "complete Danni's
journey in her memory" by holding a `Critical Mass' with hundreds of cyclists
taking over the road on the route between her work in Shoreham and house in
Worthing.  Leisa Tomaszewski, from Worthing Friends of the Earth, said: "We'd
like to make this a really big event. Danni was an artist who had just held her
first exhibition in London. She lightened a lot of people's lives, and she will
be a great loss to us all. We want to celebrate Danni's life as well as protest
about the horrific way it ended."<p>
<STRONG>              Worthing Critical Mass Sat. Sept. 20th meet 12noon Shoreham

<A NAME="huntingdon">Sab the Lab</A></h2>

<p>
Barry Horne's four-week old hunger strike in protest at the government's U-turn
on animal welfare has seen the growth of anti-vivisection protests:<STRONG>
Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS)</STRONG> in Cambridgeshire, one of the UK's largest
vivisection labs (and the subject of a horrific Channel 4 documentary last
March) is to see a permanent protest camp set up on their doorstep, and
continue until it is closed. <p>
With the recent closure of Consort, the tide seems to be turning against the
abusers- with no thanks to the new Labour junta. A recent letter to a Luton
activist from a government department denied any need for a Royal Commission to
look into vivisection...in direct contradiction of pre-election promises. <p>
The Animal Rights movement does not have much experience of protest camps so
bodies, equipment, help and advice from EF!/anti-road activists is desperately
needed. HLS - and the camp - are situated on the East side of the A1, just
North of the A1/A14 intersection near Huntingdon.<p>
The bad publicity generated by the TV programme have led to shares plummeting
by [sterling]80 million; many major customers have pulled out and staff morale
is at rock bottom. Two employees, seen on TV hurling a beagle against a wall
and abusing others for kicks, are currently up in court on charges under the
Protection Of Animals Act, and regular demos outside the premises have seen
shame-faced staff locking themselves in the car park and leaving only under
heavy police escort. <p>
HLS, who at any one time have <EM>62,500 animals being experimented on</EM>, have
their licence up for renewal in November - some sustained pressure could see
them stand a real chance of losing it. <p>

<STRONG><LI>	</STRONG>	Activists attempting to peacefully protest at the <STRONG>Hillgrove cat
farm </STRONG>at Minster Lovell, near Witney, last Monday were obstructed and
assaulted by police.  150 demonstrators arrived to find that police had invoked
Section 60 of the CJA on <EM>all</EM> of the roads around Minster Lovell and
Witney. The roads blocked, protesters decided to drop in at Jack Straw's gaff
instead, for a chat about vivisection and prison policy. They were greeted by
100 riot cops, who sporadically attacked the protestors. 4 people were
arrested.  2 were later released without charge. <STRONG>Barry Horne Support
