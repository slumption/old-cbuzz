<h2>
<A NAME="stringer">Stringers Common-Criminal</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Road protesters were celebrating victory this week, as a road
widening scheme at Stringers Common near Guildford was
<strong>abandoned</strong>.<p>
Protesters who were down tunnels and up trees in anticipation for an early
Monday morning eviction, instead heard news that because of cuts in national
funding Surrey County Council were unable to find the &#163;2.9m needed to
carry out the scheme.<p>
Activists from the five camps were jubilant. Vicky, one of the first to make
Stringers her home said: <em>&quot;This is a victory not only for the local
people but for everyone that has dared to stand up to car culture. If the camps
and tunnels had not been here this road would have gone ahead. The cost of
evictions would have made it impossible and direct action has again proved to
be a successful tactic in defending our environment.&quot;</em><p>
<em></em>At a loose end after the Stringers victory? Fancy some action in the
countryside? Here's a selection of camps...<p>
<UL>
<LI><strong>Bingley, W.Yorks</strong>: Rye Loaf Camp set up to oppose a bypass,
urgently needs more people. 0370 985122.
<LI><strong>Lyminge Forest, Kent</strong>: The Rank Organisation plan to destroy a
thousand acres of land including ancient forest for a massive leisure complex.
01227 261057.
<LI><strong>Wyndham Hill, Yeovil</strong>: Camp set up to oppose a new road and
retail development proposed on the site where activists successfully stopped a
Sainsbury's 2 years ago. 01935 478806.
<LI><strong>Faslane Peace Camp</strong> - established for 15 years on the banks of
the Gareloch and Britain's oldest peace camp are holding a birthday party on
14-15th June. Party and protest against Trident 01436 820901.
<LI><strong>A16 Action Group</strong>: opposing <em>Peaks Parkway</em> A16
diversion along a disused railway line in Grimsby which is a popular local
wildlife walk. Contact Stop the Road On Peaks Parkway (STROPP): 01472 278845.
See next story.
</UL>
Graham Stringer (new Labour MP for Blakley) however has other ideas. He writes
<em>&quot;The trespassers at Manchester Airport come from the same political
tradition as Mussolini and Pol Pot in rejecting the ballot box in favour of
direct action and violence.&quot;</em><p>
SchNEWS would like to point out Mr. Stringer's unbiased view has nothing to do
with him being Chair of the Board for Manchester Airport and ask that if he is
such a passionate democrat, why not place the Board of the Airport up for
direct election by the people of Manchester? <p>
And as good old Jo Makepeace from Justice? said at last weeks Direct Action
Conference: <em>&quot;It's all about people getting off their arses and doing
things for themselves now, not waiting for the politicians to act for us. A
cross on a piece of paper every five years...that's generous.&quot; </em><p>
<UL>
<LI><strong>Eviction alert!</strong>Activists opposing Manchester's second runway are on red
alert and are advising people to get there by the weekend for possible
evictions 0161 834 8221.

<h2><A NAME="parkway">Peaks Parkway</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>We've not mentioned them before, but they've been giving it
some in Grimsby for a few years now: the A16 Action Group are opposing a 5km
diversion of the A16 along the &quot;Peaks Parkway&quot;, the disused
Grimsby-Louth railway line. This is a popular, well-used recreational area
oozing with wildlife - a rare oasis of beauty in Grimsby - and it is
doubly insensitive coming from a council supposedly so skint it has to
charge the elderly for care services.
<P>
A recent week of peaceful direct action resulted in several arrests
and kids injured by reckless machine operators. One 16 year old was
given bail on condition she doesn't go within 100m of the site - which
rules out both home and school! Anyway, after years in the protest
backwaters they need your help - so get in contact with STROPP on
01472 278845 and get involved.

<h2>
<A NAME="agm">AGM</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>

<strong></strong><em>&quot;One of the main points to come out of the
conference is the need to attack the oil industry in several places at
once, and in as many varied ways as possible.Their PR machine needs a
good talking to; their investors must be persuaded to put their money
somewhere more useful. New recruits must be told to get a proper
job.&quot;</em><br> <strong>- Corporate Watch</strong><p>

<em></em>Yes, it's AGM time again! Last fortnight it was the turn of
BAe, now it's the turn of grubby multinationals Shell and RTZ to have
their dirty laundry held up for public scrutiny. First up were mining
giants RTZ: ducking questions about pollution in Bolivia; the
appalling situation in Bougainville; human rights abuses at the
Grasberg Copper Mine in Irian Jaya; Indonesia; and mining plans that
threaten Madagascan rainforests and a sacred mountain in the
Philippines, the directors chose instead merely to inform the assembly
that Grasberg produces &#163;125m per year in taxes for the Indonesian
government.<p>

Last weekend saw Hammersmith Unemployed Workers' Centre host a gathering of the
clans against the oil industry under the banner of <strong>CRUDE
OPERATORS</strong>, a <em>Corporate Watch</em> &amp; <em>Platform</em> joint
venture, featuring speakers from all over the world on virtually every aspect
of the worlds dirtiest industry, oil. Corporate Watch (CW) told SchNEWS,
<em>&quot;Following the by now familiar pattern of `spend Saturday finding out
about it, Saturday night eating and partying, Sunday working out what to
<strong>DO</strong> about it, and the rest of the week actually doing it',
Monday saw a particularly fragrant oil slick smeared all over the front of the
DTI in Westminster, highlighting the strange resemblance between David Simon,
chair of British Petroleum plc (boo) and David Simon, Minister for
Competitiveness and Europe in Tony Blair's new cabinet. Lots of mess, lots of
ranting, lots of fun. Lovely.</em><p>

<em>&quot;Wednesday was the Shell AGM where a slick PR excercise
dismissed any critics as `ill-informed' or `violent extremists'. This
tactic meant that decent actions in the meeting would have played
straight into their hands&quot; </em>point out CW, who add however
that <em>&quot;9% of the Shell share capital is now on our side - only
another 42% to go.&quot;</em> And on Thursday (as we go to press)
Shell is releasing its environment report to tell the world how nice
they are. Let's hope none of those ill-informed violent extremists get
in to put the record straight...

<strong>Satpal Ram</strong> is on hunger strike after a surprise move from
Gartree Prison in Leicestershire, to Wandsworth in London. On 18 April, he was
moved forcibly in a bodybelt and put in a bare strip cell. He's now refusing
all food, demanding an end to his mistreatment. Satpal has been inside since
1986, sentenced to life for the self-defence killing of a racist who attacked
him in a restaurant. In those 11 years, Ram has been beaten up, repeatedly
moved, kept in isolation, subject to humiliating body searches and had drugs
planted on him. <p>

juries, interference of defence witnesses, destruction of custody records and
deals made between the police and remand prisoners for shorter sentences in
return for testifying against Gilbert. Gilbert is currently not allowed to
contact the press (!), and has been denied access to vital personal belongings
and is on &quot;basic regime&quot;.<p>

Writing letters is one of the best ways you can <strong>support a
prisoner</strong>. Prison distances you from the real world, and a friendly
card or letter lets the person on the inside know that they have not been
forgotten. Remember a few important things - letters are always read, so don't
write anything that could jeopardise future actions, or anyone's freedom.
Always include a return address, as some prisons don't accept a letter without
a return address. If you can't think of anything to write, just send a nice
postcard.

<A NAME="wales">Wot a comedown...</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>A party in North Wales was completely obliterated and a sound
system confiscated last Bank Holiday Weekend.  Police helicopters watched the
T.W.A.T. Chaos, BWPT &amp; other systems setting up at a disused quarry.
Early evening the Chef Inspector said pack up and bugger off and there would be
no trouble! However when the systems were leaving the police blocked off access
roads and the riot squad turned up in van loads confiscating the T.W.A.T.
system and arresting the driver. Meanwhile a 4 mile convoy of party cars were
dispersed to the English Border, and two big Parties <strong>did</strong> kick
off in the end, Wolfie of Twat told SchNEWS: <em>&quot;It shows just how
many are up for it, and as Spiral Tribe said - they might stop a party but they
can't stop the future.&quot;</em>

<h2>
<A NAME="finally">...and finally...</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>We've all heard about brave fire-fighters being asked to
rescue pussies stuck up trees (ouch, sorree!), but Saturday's call out surely
took the biscuit. Randy Sandy, a blow-up doll had been stuck on one of
Brighton's CCTV cameras by activists pointing out that camera technology is now
so advanced it can strip people of their clothes! Brighton Police however were
not amused and rung for the fire brigade to remove offending objects including
a startled looking Sandy.<p>
Nine other cameras were also targeted by activists - stirred into action by a
talk on surveillance at Justice's? Direct Action Conference. Apart from Sandy,
one camera had a bag put over it head, while one resident refused to come down
for two hours from a pole, complaining that it looks straight into his bedroom
window. Meanwhile a mobile spy camera was placed on a nearby block of flats
watching the entrance of the Conference and later in the day two cops walked
into a crowded pub and arrested someone they'd spotted on their `rogues
gallery.' Brighton CCTV control room is linked up to a face recognition
programme which has a role call of people on the `wanted list' enabling them to
cross check files on known activists and pick up any they consider to be
wanted.<p>
As one London activist complained to SchNEWS <em>&quot;It's all very well going
on actions knowing you have a chance of being nicked, but when your in the pub
chatting someone up and your mate gets pulled then things are really getting
out of hand.&quot;</em>
