<A NAME="jsa">PEANUTS!</A></h2>
<p>

<STRONG>As everybody's favourite Job Seekers Allowance gets ready to
celebrate its first birthday on October 1st, the unemployed are in for
a new wave of benefit bashing with New Labour's New Deal.</STRONG><p>

The <STRONG>Welfare to Work</STRONG> programmes look set to begin in
12 trial areas in January, with the programme going countrywide from
April `98.  &#163;3.5 million is to be spent trying to take a quarter
of a million 18-25 year olds off the dole and putting more than half
the long-term unemployed into subsidised jobs or training. <p>

After an "intensive job guidance and counselling" programme lasting up
to 4 months, people will have to choose one of<A HREF="#options"> four
options</A>. Refuse - and you'll lose your benefit.  As Employment
Secretary Frank Field pointed out, <EM>"there will be <STRONG>no
</STRONG>fifth option of continued full benefit." </EM> However, one
brave Labour councillor told a TUC Fringe meeting last week "<EM>It's
a new National Service, there is no fifth option apart from drugs,
crime and homelessness."</EM><p>

Andrew Smith, the employment minister in day-to-day charge of the New
Deal said <EM>"These are quality options - quality has to run through
the programme like a seam of gold. But, for fit young people,
continuing on benefit is not going to be an option."</EM> <p>

The bidding for those who want to run the programme will begin in
October, and claimant's action group <STRONG>Groundswell</STRONG>
reckons the Employment Service will continue with the training
providers already in place for Project Work, Training for Work and
Restart Courses - <EM>"despite the fact that everyone knows these
outfits are a joke."</EM><p>

Meanwhile, while much has been said of the <STRONG>sanctions</STRONG>
that will be used on the unemployed who refuse to co-operate, little
has been said about employees who will inevitably take advantage of
the scheme to replace workers with cheap labour. Employment Policy
Institute director John Philpott warned that employers with a high
labour turnover were bound to try to use the subsidy <EM>"There is a
risk that the scheme could end up validating the revolving door labour
market." </EM><p>

We at SchNEWS have heard it all before - as every new scheme to
`benefit' the unemployed has been announced, the politicians begin
sounding like a Persil advert - `Yes, it's our new <EM>improved</EM>
brand of slavery which will really get rid of those nasty greasy
unemployable stains this time.'<p> 

The reality is that unemployment is here to stay...after all wasn't
this meant to be the so-called `age of leisure'? Yet in the UK, we
work the longest hours in Europe (and a recent report by the TUC found
that nearly <STRONG>half </STRONG>the workforce in Britain were
suffering from some forms of stress) and according to an Unemployment
Unit spokesperson, have the <EM>"meanest, toughest unemployment
benefit system in all Europe."</EM><p>

As one claimants' activist told SchNEWS <EM>"If the options aren't
good enough - people should have the option not to bother."</EM> <p>

In Brighton, while at least six people chase every job, the
entertainment backbone of the town relies on musicians, artists,
playwrights who are on the dole...but hardly unemployed.<p>

And finally, surely SchNEWS has been reporting about an unpaid
environmentalist task force which has been out and about trying to
stop developers trashing the country for the past few years?  Or as
Groundswell puts it: <EM>"It's just Community Service for the
unemployed, as if they were guilty of a crime against society. It
sounds just like the work camps for the unemployed which Old Labour
ran in the `30s."</EM>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading2">Project Work - Down The Pan?</A></h3>

<p>In Brighton an unlikely alliance of anarchos, trade unionists,
claimants and socialists have been dealing blow after blow to the
Project Work-for-your-dole scheme introduced in April.<p> Everything
from office occupations to the picketing of charity shops using forced
labour has been used, and claimants turning up for the scheme are
regularly leafleted to let them know what's going on. 10 claimants
have even joined the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union!<p>
Brighton and Hove Council are boycotting the scheme, quoting the EC
Convention on Human Rights banning forced labour, saying<EM> `any
attempt to coerce the unemployed into Project Work... is a wholesale
attack on the unemployed and will only enforce lower
wages</EM>'. Meanwhile the Brighton Volunteer Bureau have written to
over 200 local groups condemning the scheme. <p> Its futility and
failure can clearly be seen in the two areas where the scheme was
first piloted. In Kent work-slaves have painted one gate at Napoleonic
Fort Anherst <STRONG>27 times</STRONG>; while in Hull, only 366 out of more than
3,000 people were found McJobs.<p> In Brighton, four voluntary
organisations who initially took on placements' have backed out of the
scheme due to pressure from the claimants' union.  Some
- including <STRONG>OXFAM</STRONG> - talk of being lied to by `the providers' -
the company which gets cash for finding placements crap jobs. These
naughty providers, aware of the schemes' popularity, have been ringing
up voluntary groups and asking them if they want some volunteers!
Pardon us, but if you refuse to go to work at these places, you lose
all benefit - hardly a voluntary option! <p> Project Work is just the
thin end of the wedge. In New York public sector workers in the Subway
have been replaced by the unemployed on workfare schemes.  But as
`<STRONG>welfare to work</STRONG>' has no fifth option it too is
nothing short of
workfare. An activist told SchNEWS <EM>"Victory against project work will
hopefully act as domino effect for the rest of the country and strengthen
peoples resolve to fight the new welfare to work menace."  </EM>

<h3>
<A NAME="options">The Four Options:</A></h3>

<p>
<UL>

<LI><STRONG>Work</STRONG>: The employer gets a &#163;60-a-week subsidy to employ
someone for six months at a standard wage. The job must include a one
day a week training for which a grant of &#163;750 is paid.<p>

<LI><STRONG> Full time study: </STRONG>on an approved course for up to a year
for people without NVQ Level 2 qualifications or similar.<p>

<LI><STRONG> Six months voluntary work:</STRONG> claimants get benefit plus a
grant of up to &#163;400 paid in instalments. The job must include one
day a week training.  Up to &#163;3,200 will be paid to the voluntary
organisation to facilitate the placement.<p>

<LI><STRONG> Environmental Task Force:</STRONG> to carry out work to improve
local environments. Conditions to be the same as above.<p>
</UL>

Some or all of these options will also be introduced for all long term
unemployed (over 2 years).<p> 

Sanctions for under-25's who refuse to take part in the New Deal
programme are essentially the same as those introduced with the
JSA. Refuse to take up any of the options without "good reason", and
<STRONG>all benefit </STRONG>will be withdrawn for two weeks, four weeks and
then indefinitely. As under the JSA, the penalty will only be a 40 per
cent lose of benefit, if the claimant is deemed "vulnerable".

30th September sees the eleventh anniversary of the kidnapping of <STRONG>MORDECHAI
VANUNU</STRONG>, a nuclear technician who in 1986 leaked information to the London
Sunday Times about the secret Israeli nuclear weapons programme. Kidnapped in
Rome by Israeli intelligence agents, he was tried in secret for treason and
espionage, and sentenced to 18 years. He has spent almost <STRONG>11 years </STRONG>in
solitary confinement, there are serious concerns for his mental health. To mark
the anniversary of his kidnapping, an international delegation is to hold a
vigil from 22-30 Sept at Ashkelton Prison, where he is being held, and other
important locations in Israel.<p>

<STRONG>PABLO LOCKE </STRONG> was banged up for life after defending himself against `a
psycho with a multitude of violent convictions.' Pablo was no angel but he
didn't deserve a life sentence. He writes <EM>"Think about the last ten years
and then think of me, I've missed the lot. Now, can you imagine the anger I
feel? For what I did I should have got 8 years tops. I don't ever ask for pity
mate just a little understanding... Personally  I think people should know what
is really happening in this countries penal system. The suicide problem is
getting worse and the special units are getting similar to the cages that Jimmy
Boyle wrote about years back." </EM>Because he refuses to tow the prison line
the likelihood of his release in the near future is very slim. He adds <EM>"the
whole point of the lifer system is to break the man's spirit."</EM><p>

<A NAME="algeria">Algeria</A></h2>

<p>The same weekend that an ex-Royal, her partner and their drunk
driver died in a Paris tunnel, over <STRONG>500 Algerian
citizens</STRONG> had their throats slit, were burned alive or shot
dead in Rais, Algeria. This death toll represents the single greatest
loss of life in the country since the army took over in 1992. Since
then, <EM>sixty thousand</EM> people have died at the hands of the
right wing government regime. The UK has benefited from the lucrative
arms sales to the regime and <STRONG>BP</STRONG> are happily
exploiting the country's huge oil reserves. Funny how, during all the
turmoil, neither gas or oil production has once been interrupted or
threatened.
