<em>&quot;We'll only stop giving out leaflets when they agree to stop forcing
their views down our throats with their advertising&quot;<br></em><strong>-
Dave Morris</strong><p>
<strong></strong>On Thursday 19th June at 10:30, Mr. Justice Bell began his
personal summing up of the McLibel trial, almost three years since the whole
saga began. He played to a packed courtroom of over 100 journalists, witnesses
and legal experts, and took almost two hours to deliver his verdict, reading
from a document over 1,000 pages long. More protesters and followers of the
case lined the external corridor, waiting with bated breath for the final
verdict. <p>
Helen Steel and Dave Morris have spent 314 days (three times the length of the
previous longest libel trial) fighting a libel case brought by McDonald's who
accused the pair of seven charges of defamation, based on a 1987 leaflet
`What's Wrong With McDonald's'. The original leaflet was split into seven
categories: McDollars, McGreedy, McCancer, McMurder, McRipoff, McTorture and
McGarbage - and accused McDonald's of underpaying staff, cruelty to animals,
exploiting developing countries, corrupting children, destroying rainforests
and producing food of inadequate nutrition. <p>
<em>&quot;Libel cases are brought to censor and silence the `truth'. The fact
that we've gone through three years of the case, and come out the other end,
maintaining distribution of the leaflet, launching the McSpotlight web site and
seen the growth of the campaign means we have won!  The real court is the court
of public opinion, and we won't accept the stifling of our voices. The public
are the jury in this case.&quot; </em><br><strong>- Dave Morris</strong><p>
<strong></strong>A full two hours later, the court room cleared and Helen and
Dave were greeted with cheers from the soggy masses assembled outside the Royal
Courts of Justice.<p>
Although the verdict represents a major victory for the McLibel 2, they didn't
win on all counts and have been stung with a wackin' &#163;60,000 worth of
damages to pay to McDonald's.<p>
SchNEWS asked Dave how the two intended to pay the costs. <em>&quot;Oh, we
don't&quot;</em> he smiled. Helen responded <em>&quot;We're not going to pay
the damages, McDonald's don't deserve a penny of it, and we haven't got any
money anyway!&quot;</em><p>
The real victory lies in the fact that two low waged individuals refused to
back down from the bully boy tactics of this $30billion corporation, and
continued the fight until the end, <em>without legal aid or the help of a
jury</em>. They both went into the trial, totally ignorant in the whys and
wherefores of the legal system, and came out the other side. <em>And</em> they
won two of the charges outright, and partly won two other charges. Much of the
judgements relied on legal interpretations of the leaflet. They only lost on
legal technicalities and points of law, all the evidence brought into the court
was found in favour of Helen and Dave. <p>
McDonald's attempts to silence their critics has been a huge public relations
disaster, and now there is more information available on McDonald's than ever
before. Over two million  leaflets have been distributed since it was first
published in 1987, and the excellent McSpotlight website is home to 500
megabytes of information (That's 500 floppy disks!) and has been visited by 13
million readers since it went on line <p>
The UK libel laws favour the rich , and this case was particularly oppressive
and unfair to Steel and Morris. The two intend to take their case to the
European Court of Human Rights, in order to overturn the decision and to
attempt to get a ruling that multi-national corporations shouldn't have
recourse to libel laws in cases such as this. Only the rich and powerful have
access to the libel laws because of the excessive costs involved.<p>
<em>&quot;We must continue to defend the public's right to voice attack on
multi-national corporations&quot;</em><br><strong>- Charles Secrett, Friends of
the Earth</strong><p>
<strong></strong>A national day of action is planned to occur all around the
country at different McDonalds restaurants this Saturday.  Over 500 stores
throughout the country look set to be picketed by protesters, between them
distributing another 400,000 or so `What's Wrong With McDonalds' Leaflets<p>
Fun and games are anticipated in Brighton. Meet 11am onwards at the London Rd
McDonalds.

<A NAME="europe">EU RO TOP</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong><em>&quot;It seems that perhaps a quarter of Amsterdam has
been sealed off for the duration behind metal-mesh screens, guarded by bored
police...Beyond the screens, real life goes on. Local residents are just about
allowed to filter through to their front doors, and the odd roller-bladder
scoots by. They watch us, and we watch them, as if at some European safari
park. This is the Peoples Europe 1997, the latest attempt to bring the EU
closer to its citizens.&quot;<br>- </em><strong>Stephen Bates, The
Guardian</strong><p>
<strong></strong>Forget Tony Blair winning the bike race here's a few stories
about Amsterdam the media haven't told you about...
<h3>
<A NAME="sat">Saturday June 14th  </A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>About 50,000 people from all different European countries turn
out for a March for Social Justice.<p>
A couple of thousand Italians do a mass `train-bunk' and head for Amsterdam. On
arriving the Dutch police won't allow anyone to leave the station and arrest
200 people for allegedly damaging a couple of carriages. In protest people
occupy one of the main road junctions outside the station. Police with batons
drawn, attempt to clear the road and later in the evening the Italians are all
deported. At one point their train is stopped in the middle of nowhere in
Germany and all the windows blacked. The German and Dutch police authorities
apparently wanted the Italian police to guarantee to arrest them all when they
got back to their country - but the Italian authorities refused! 
<h3>
<A NAME="sun">Sunday</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>12 pm Amsterdam railway station - time for a street party.
Four soundsystems head for Visserplein Square and began to party. However, the
people with the systems strike a deal with the cops and shortly move to the
warehouse where a free party organised by the LegaliZE campaign had been the
night before...<p>
Sex riot - a media stunt consisting of a few people dressing up in extremely
outrageous gear with sex toys strapped to their heads and bodies respond to the
Mayor of Amsterdam's comments that this is `a great cultural city not simply
about sex and drugs.'<p>
350 people leave a squatted punk bar to march towards the police station to
demand release of people nicked on the previous nights.  Police suddenly seal
off the whole area and over a three hour period quick-cuff and arrest everyone
under Article 140. This states that the police are allowed to arrest someone
they believe to be a member of a criminal organisation if they suspect that
organisation of planning criminal activity -  giving them powers to hold those
nicked for 3 days. Over a hundred  refuse food and water at protest at being
detained.
<h3>
<A NAME="mon">Monday</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>About a thousand people demonstrate outside a refugee prison
in the outskirts of Amsterdam. Tennis balls were thrown into the compound with
messages of support taped to them. <p>
10,000 Kurdish people in central Amsterdam  protest against Turkey joining the
EC.<p>
Evening time and quite a number of people go round various hotels in which
European heads of states are staying. About a hundred people are nicked for
going into a restricted area. 
<h3>
<A NAME="tue">Tuesday</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Police ban a demonstration aimed at disrupting  the final day
of the summit where the EU leaders present their new `Amsterdam  Treaty'. 
<h3>
<A NAME="wed">Wednesday</A></h3>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>International protest in solidarity with all those arrested.
In London, activist broke into the Dutch embassy and got as far as the roof
before being asked politely to leave by armed diplomatic police! The clever Met
decide to hassle a load of Dutch tourists queuing up to get visas, thinking
they are part of the demo<p>

<A NAME="genetics">Forever In Blue Genes</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>It gets more bizarre - Monsanto has discovered a gene that
will turn cotton blue! Meanwhile the backlash against genetic engineering
continues - in Germany four fields are being squatted to prevent the planting
of genetically modified seeds - while another field of mutant spuds got trashed
in Quedlingburg earlier this month. <p>
For any would be mutant mashers the idea of squatting the fields is simple- get
there before the seeds are planted and stay until it is too late in the year to
sow the seed. This sort of activity is on the increase and some fields in
Germany are now under permanent police protection!<p>

<strong></strong>On Monday - after 17 days underground at the site of the
proposed second runway at Manchester airport, Matt emerged from the cakehole
tunnel - and claimed his stake in the Book of Records. However, the protests
continue. On Wednesday, activists were at a posh annual dinner to ask Geoff
Muirhead, the chief exec of Manchester Airport to ask why work has already
started despite the fact that the European Commission still has not cleared the
legality of funding of the second runway. The Coalition Against Runway 2 told
SchNEWS  &quot;the camps may have been evicted but the campaign against the
runway continues&quot;. Contact them on 0161 834 8221.

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>Activists who were all set to move into Sherwood and do battle
with the Sheriff of Nottingham, after reports that a theme park was to be
built, will be happy to know that the gossip may have been exaggerated.
Developer Mike Mills has had permission refused for him to build a tacky stone
castle and 111 chalets in some woodland that isn't part of Sherwood Forest. So
afraid that he might overrun by enthusiastic protesters, he has offered to take
people down to the site to prove his plans are alright - and that if he ever
got permission he'd plant 8000 deciduous trees just to prove he's a nice guy!

<A NAME="finally">and finally</A></h2>

<strong></strong><p>
<strong></strong>The tale of the travellers at Horsdean, Brighton gets
stranger. First, SchNEWS sat in disbelief in court last week as the judge
talked of the `nightmare of the law' and the fact that he'd known travellers
for years and years and &quot;they are wonderful people.&quot; Telling us
`crafty co-operation is better then confrontation' he still gave travellers 4
weeks to get out of town but in the meantime to talk to the
council&quot;But&quot; spluttered the solicitor representing Brighton and Hove
&quot;our traveller liaison officers are scared of travellers.&quot; <p>
Come again? What next SchNEWS asks - a nurse scared of blood, a vet frightened
of animals? Perhaps the council should have employed the one traveller who went
for the job of liaison officer. He was turned down - because he didn't live in
a house! Then a fax arrives at our office where the leader of thr Council and
ex-squatter Bassam, who a week earlier had barked he would be &quot;driving the
travellers out of town. The policy of tolerating them has finished&quot; - now
talks about &quot;looking for a spirit of co-operation from the
travellers...The judge has dealt with the case in a humane and thoughtful
manner..&quot; Just like you have Councillor Bassam. <p>
The Horsdean crew now plan to go to judicial review...watch this space.
