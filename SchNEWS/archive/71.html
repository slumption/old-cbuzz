"T'was a Friday in April 1986<br>
The day when the nightmare began<br>
When the dust it fell down on our buildings ands treets<br>
And entered the buildings at noon<br>
Touched the grass and the trees, bicycles, cars<br>
Beds, books and picture frames too<br>
We stood around, helpless, confused<br>
Nobody knew what to do."<p>
Lyrics from "Farewell to Pripchat (near Chernobyl)" by Christy Moore and Tim Donnehy.<p>

Such was the scene, ten years ago today in the Ukrainain town of Chernobyl. It's residents, and consequently it's people, were subjected to what was arguably the worst environmental disaster in human history. <p>

"This has been like a Third World War for our country. You talk about pre- and post war; we talk about before and after Chernobyl." <p>Professor Igor Rolevitch, Deputy Minister for Emergencies, Chernobyl.<p>

Initially the Soviet authorities hushed up the disaster, as they had successfully done in the past, such as the horrific incident at the Chelyabinsk in 1957. However, as information as well as radiation leaked out from the devastated region, it became impossible to carry out the clear up operation in secret. Before long Western help was forthcoming, but not in time to help the initial 'Liquidator' crews of Belarussians and Ukrainaians sent in to fight the fire. The shockwave went right across Europe. In Finland 4,000 women pledged to not bear children until the Finnish government cancelled it's nuclear power programme. In polls 70-80% of Europeans said they were against the expansion of the nuclear industry. The Caesium fallout from the blast spread as far west as Ireland and down to Greece. Non-geographically, the consequences of Chernobyl went much further than that. <p>
"Trust in science has taken a very heavy blow. The caesium is transmitted in food chains... and over to political, economic and social structures of the human world. This has the effect of dissolving the glue that holds these structures together."
(P. Gould's Fire in the Rain: The  Democratic Consequences of Chernobyl.)

<p>Today, barely any of the Liquidator crew personnel are alive to tell the tale. Many of them were sent in to the reactor with only a gauze mask as protection, and have paid a heavy price for their bravery and/or ignorance. <p>

"Most people did not even know they should take elementary precautions... I saw children running Around in shorts, women out shopping, winodws wide open in the warm air.  I went off to share a bottle of vodka with a friend before going to bed." Vladimir Zabolodnikh, Power Station water monitor. <p>

This week a fresh tragedy hit the area when fires caused by a dropped cigarette butt swept through five highly contaminated villages. Highly contaminated smoke billowed upwards. Present at the time were ex-villagers who are allowed back once a year to tend to graves. So upset were they by this, that they refused to move from the site. This was only miles from the still-burning core of Reactor Four, which is covered in dangerously cracked concrete.  More than two million people in Belarus alone are still living on contaminated land. Scientists have recently found a sinister wildlife discovery: voles that thrive on radioactive pollution. Apparently the genetic make-up of the Supervoles are mutating at an incredible rate. "Two hundred years from now, we may be living with organisms that are genetically quite different from today's." John Bickham, University of Texas.<p>

As far as the British anti-nuclear direct action movement is concerned, the halcyon days of the 1980's may have gone, but it is still coming up with storming actions. From super-gluing themselves inside power stations to locking onto the back of nuclear trains, (as well as loads of less strenuous stuff) activists continue to oppose nuclear encroachment. They have been facing similar problems as the anti-roads movement, only for many more years. For example, the Faslane Peace camp in Dumbartonshire (01436 820901), resident for 14 years, is threatened with imminent eviction.<p>
This week a nuclear train due to travel from Dungeness to Sellafield was cancelled by BR because of a peace camp next to the tracks at Hither Green, South London. Trains carrying nuclear fuel rods and waste travel most weeks through London. This weekend millions of people around the planet will descend upon their nearest nuclear installation to register their disgust, with the main British protest will be at Sellafield. From April 12-26th in the Ukraine a Walk for a Nuclear Free Future has been going on. <p>
Other projects have spawned to help alleviate the suffering of the people of Chernobyl. The Chernobyl Childrens Project, set up in Ireland by Adi Roche, has so far sent nearly $5 million in aid to the area. A Manchester branch of the project was launched in Manchester last year.  <p>
A group of musicians from Lancaster have come together under the name of "The Purple Zone" to produce a CD to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the accident. It will be premiered in Manchester this week. The disk is available from the Chenobyl Children's Project.<p>

<p>

It's May! It's May! Time for a holi- holiday! In our quest to bring you the truth we wanna tell you what May Day is about. A celebration of Beltane, and heralds the start of summer in the pagan calendar - signifying the death of winter and the return of the warm weather. It is a time to reflect upon people's interaction with the earth, and the importance of creating abundance for all by working and caring for the land.  It was recognised by the 1st Congress of the Second International - an assembly of socialist and labour parties formed in the 1880s.  Thie date was chosen in rememberance of the Haymarket Martyrs - working class Chicago anarchists killed by the state. They decreed the 1st of May to be a day of celebration of workers- and gave them the day off! Since then, May Day has also been known as International Workers /Labour Day, and recognised as such in many European countries and the US. 
The start of summer parties, festies, greenery and flowers, or time to honour the time held tradition of getting pissed on the beach. May is here!

<a name=ARTICLE4><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>PARTY ON? </H3></center>
<p>

The May Bank holiday Tribal Gathering is off. Cancelled. Not allowed. Cherwell District Council have refused the organisers appeal to grant a licence to hold the event, because of the traffic problems of  30,000 poeple in cars mooshing down the M40 and surrounding areas. Ian Blair, Asst. Chief Constable of Thames Valley police, said "We wish to emphasise that we have no objection to whatso-ever to music festivals. Our objections were based on the unsuitabilty of the site." SchNEWS wonders then why last years anti Criminal Justice Act (CJA) Mother festival was stopped when it was  being  held in the middle of nowhere; and what about the traffic choas during Henley Regatta, Ascot, Glyndebourne etc,  The rich nobs gatherings are allowed to go ahead in the name of 'culture'.  So what about our tradition of free gatherings?<p>
People have been getting together at festivals since time immemorial to trade, meet and celebrate, yet over the past few years the free fun scene has been totally decimated with t he introduction of the CJA - the final nail in the coffin.  As people involved in the doomed Mother festival last year would testify, the authorities are prepared to spend any amount of resources to stop us having fun without their permission.   <p>Doors were kicked in, phone lines went dead, roadblocks  set up, helicopters deployed - and Black Moon soundsystem  lost their ï¿½6,000 rig in the process - confiscated then destroyed by the police.<p>
Ten years ago the so-called 'Battle of the Beanfield' showed the direction things were going.  Since the early 70's more and more people were leaving the rat-race to live on the road.  The People's Free Festival at Stonehenge had become the mid-summer meet up point - and had grown too large and anarchic for the powers that be.  By '85 they'd had enough and flexed their muscles, trashing travellers and their vehicles. Now it seems travellers, once the back-bone of the free party scene are not wanted anywhere - Glastonbury being a prime example.<p>
Unless you can afford the ï¿½30 Tribal Gatherings of this world - when they are allowed-  where are we meant to party? On the moon? Tribal Gathering is being promoted by the commercial Mean Fiddler crew, hardly an underground organisation. Michelle from Advance Party told SchNEWS  "It just shows you that the authorities are out to crush the whole movement, be it legal, illegal, large or small."  So what are we gonna do?  Sit on yer arse, watching the TV, and let 'em get away with it- or get out there and 'ave some? The choice is yours!<p>
Want some?   Last year a free festival list was produced by Stone 2, 45, Westwood Hill, London SE26 6NS- send some stamps + SAE. <p>
The new Festival Eye is OUT! chock-a-block full of dates and articles ï¿½2 from  BCM 2002, London WC1N 3XX. <p>
<br>* Stoke Newington plods, those fine upholders of the law, investigated Club Lunacy after flyers showed an alien tokin'. They eventually closed the club down as the old bill 'didn't like the wording of the flyers'. Another examle of all out attack on the scene.

To Kit Sampson, who received an MBE 4 years ago for her work as a health visitor for travellers.  Bad enough that it was from the Tories - but totally hyprocritical since their Criminal Justice Act makes life even harder for Britains travelling population.  Her pleas to include protection for new-born babies and pregnant women in the traveller clauses went on deaf ears - so she handed the award back.  Up Yours - and nice one!

Anyone present at the end of the Valentine's Day Reclaim The Streets party in Brighton will know that the police were out of order - they even admitted as much at a recent court case.  The subsequent public meeting was loud, angry and vociferous, but now what?  Court cases have begun, people are getting charged and  crying out for witnesses, but where are they?  It's all well and good getting angry on the day,  but if we don't keep the authorities on their toes, don't follow up our anger  with action, don't stick up for each other - then what are we really about? 
Did you saw any arrests/assaults by coppers? Ring the office!  Were you unfairly treated? Sue! We know a friendly solicitor,  we've got hours of video footage, we'll give you any support you need.  What more do you want? 
<Need a decent quote please!>
* London Reclaim The Streets III  (Saturday 13th July - pencil it in to yer diaries now) promises to be a biggie - but they need musicians, DJ's, acrobats, clowns, caterers, artists, campaigners, speakers, magicians, etc. If you are interested call: 0171 281 4621 
*  And we think we're hard-core? 19 rural workers were gunned down by police after blocking an Amazon road in a land protest. Forensics found at least 10 of the dead men had been shot in the back of the neck in execution-style killings.

We have it first hand that baked beans were up for it in Newbury. They held their first direct action against invading climbers by voluntarily flinging themselves out of the treetops, in a Kamikaze style protest, landing directly onto the scabs' heads! A member of Baked Beans Against the Bypass commented, "It's time people started to take us seriously. We are deliberately selling ourselves cheap (3p a tin) in order to gain wider coverage where it splatters."<p>

Bit of a difference of opinion on the squatters estate agents.  The Tory Times claims the organisers are "highly articulate and educated" whilst the North laine Trader brands the group "clueless".  Justice?  would like to know your views.  Just to help you along (so you don't have to think about things to hard) heres a handy selection to pick from made about the group by other publications/politicans/editors/police in the last 12 monhts: "naive"; "childish"; "simplistic"; "dysfuntional anarchists"; "supreme idealists"; "spongers"; "zealots"; "airheads"; "soap-dodgers"; "an anti-social rabble"; "extremists": "terrorists" - and my personal fave - "victims of fashion".  Makes you feel all warm inside
