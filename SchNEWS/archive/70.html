Where will you be having fun in the sun in '96? The tree camps at Newbury might be gone but if you wanna party and protest there's plenty more sites to see and work to be done.... <p>

<b>A30 HONITON</b><p>
There be fun and frolics on Beltane at Fairmile, the so-called 'university for road protestors'.  Followed by eviction?  Apparently security and those nosey-parkers Brays Detective Agency have been booked for the beginning of May. Although  Fairmile is probably safe for the time being (kids on site mean  eviction procedures are more lengthy) Allercombe and the Trollheim hill-fort will be under threat immediately.<p>
<b>M66 MANCHESTER </b><p>
Despite the recent eviction of Daisy Nook, two news camps have been set up - one at Daisy Nook and another at Audenshaw (buses from Piccadilly, Manchester- 219/220/221)  A campaigner told SchNEWS "local support has been excellent". <p>
However May1st could see the possible eviction of a privately owned long-standing caravan park-up site for Showman's Guild travellers.  No alternative site has been offered. Burns security were told by contractors to control their thugs! 0161 628 4727.<p>
<b>M74, SCOTLAND.</b> <p> 
Preliminary work is set to begin on a ten-lane motorway thru' the south of Glasgow.  One of the campaigners told SchNEWS "The campaign has now gone hard-core and a camp is to be set up soon". 0141 424 1797.<p>
<b>SHERWOOD FOREST</b><p>
Beautiful homeland of outlaws, pixies and the Green Man. Soon to be turned into a major trunk road linking the A1 and M1, including 5 major industrial developments en route. Robin Hood is mighty pissed off and invites you all (apart from the 1% who 'own' 75% of our land, thank you) to a mass action from 23rd April to 1st May, with the emphasis on FUN! He says enuff is enuff- no more chopping down forests to make way for 'civilised' society, no more destruction, no more CJA. Unite and celebrate the start of summer! Contact Freedom Network 0171 582 3474; Action Line 0171 793 7343; The Land is Ours 01865 722016.
THANET WAY, KENT
Its been quiet down in Kent with a lot of people active at Newbury.  Weekly actions continue and there's a camp at Convicts Wood which is crying out for bodies (!).<p>
*  There are plans for a new camp at Selar in South Wales, the proposed home of the largest open-cast mine in Europe.  01639 720884.<p>
*  Don't forget the land is Ours urban land occupation somewhere in London on May 5th. More details on 01865 722016.

<a name=ARTICLE2><HR width=80% size=3><center><H1>NEWBURY: SEEDS OF HOPE.</H1><p></center>

Barely three weeks after the last clearance work at Newbury was completed, the forces of sustainability are on the attack. A new "Diggers" camp has been set up on the site of the old Gotan camp. This time there are no treehouses or walkways, but there is, amongst other things, a very big hole. Residents are cagey about what this is, but apparently they are trying to grow the world's biggest carrot. (It is not known yet whether the organic smell coming from this story is bullshit or manure to grow the carrot, and as far as the mystery of the hole is concerned, SchNEWS is looking into it!)<p> 
One objective of the camp is to create a market garden. John Terry, one of the Diggers said: "The community hopes to embrace all those opposing the Newbury By-pass. We plant seeds of hope, and reject the wanton destruction of the Department of Transport. Just as our seeds will grow, opposition to the by-pass grows. The action for today's Diggers mirrors that of their forebears in seeking to establish a just, equitable and sustainable future for the people of this land."<p>
<b>Get involved! Sunday 21st April.</b><p> Meet 2pm by the Gotan Camp, Wantage Road (B4494), beside (what was) Snelsmore. Bring tools and seeds.
<b><p>Third Battle office 01635 45544 <p>Info-line 01635 550552</b>

All the camps have the usual wish-list of  wood, rope, tools, nets, chain-link fencing blah, blah, blah but most importantly they need YOU! 
<p>*One to watch for the summer - The Rank Organisation are planning to build a 432 acre holiday village in the ancient Lyminge forest an area of Outstanding Beauty near Folkestone, Kent.

Forward thinking Kent Police have taken to nicking people's instruments! An impromptu musical demo at Dover Port wound up coppers so bad that made off with one mans drum!

<a name=ARTICLE4><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>NEWBURY CONTRACT UPDATE</H3></center>
<p>

<p>


"In a congested, polluted world, short of energy, efforts to make transport cleaner and more efficient should be welcomed- but only if these efforts are made in the context of policies that give absolute priority to those forms of land use and modes of transport- walking, cycling and local bus services- that promote a human scale of living. Present priorities are fast creating a bleak, alienated, polarised and de-humanised world."
John Adams, reader in Geography, University College, London. (Taken from a paper on World Transport Policy to be published in June.)

<a name=ARTICLE6><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>M25 & LONDON RAIL SCHEME AXED</H3></center>
<p>

Two recent government decisions clearly showed that their rhetoric on transport policy is exactly that. Whilst giving the go-ahead for a five or six lane M25 widening, they scrapped the �2.7b London Cross-Rail scheme. Proposals for the M25 mean cutting a huge swathe through the Metropolitan greenbelt between Thorpe and Colnbrook, near Staines (Junctions 12-15). As usual, SSSI's are under threat (two), a Bronze Age settlement, and a couple of ancient monuments or two- all must GO. 
Meanwhile the Cross-Rail project, conceived in 1988, has so far cost �140 million, money now effectively down the drain forever. Conversely, there is a fantastic new government transport solution in the pipeline. Transport minister Steven Norris is to chair a working party to develop a National Policy on...walking! There has been a 16% drop in the amount we walk in the last three years. This policy is then sorely needed, as if these trends continue, in 12 YEARS TIME NO ONE WILL WALK ANYWHERE! If you have forgotten how to walk, then ring the DoT FeetFirst Helpline (0171 271 5000).

<p>

The third Reclaim the Streets  (RTS) extravaganza will be held on July 13th. The 'Festival of Resistance' promises to be a biggie. More details as we get them. 0171 281 4621 to find out yourselves.

<center><p><b>RTS -  BRIGHTON</b><p></center>
A Brighton RTS defendant has been bound over to 'be nice for a year' this week.  The police on the day of the trial dropped charges in exchange for a binding over order which, in effect, finds the defendant not guilty of the charge but protects the police's arses from being sued for wrongful arrest.  The prosecution placed great emphasis on the defendants supposed political views rather than on what he was accused of doing.  It's guilt by what you think now, rather than what you do! <p>
The arresting officer admitted during the proceedings that the policing of RTS was a shambles and contributed to the disorder of the day. 'We employed an arrowhead formation, intending to paddle people out to the side of the road.  I don't think we'll be using it again.'

Did you see these men get nicked?</H3></center>
<p>

Well known man-about-town Tony Rebel-Green was found guilty under Section 5 of the Public Order Act at Brighton Magistrate's Court this week. He is appealing against the sentence at Crown Court and desperately needs witnesses who saw him get nicked. Another victim of the police's arrest 'em all attitude on the day was an Asian bloke who wasn't part of the party and was only waiting for friends outside a shop! Approached by some cops and told to move on, he refused. He was then pushed and threatened with arrest, and as he walked off was overheard muttering "This is fucked up" - 'You're Nicked! ' under the old chestnut section 5 of the Public Order Act.  If anyone saw the arrests ring the Justice? office 01273 685913 </center><p>

<a name=ARTICLE9><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>STOKE NEWINGTON DRUGS SCANDAL</H3></center>
<p>

In December, three Stoke Newington officers were acquitted of perverting the cause of justice and perjury in two separate trials. This saw the end of the Met's �Operation Jackpot' which had investigated allegations of drug dealing and theft by Stoke Newington PCs. <p>
45 police officers were investigated by 'Operation Jackpot' between Dec 88 and Nov 92. Only one officer, DC Lewadowski, was convicted, on charges of theft. Not one officer was charged with a drugs offence, despite an acceptance in court that Lewadowski had earned up to �2,000 a week supplying drugs, and official recognition by senior Met officers that Stoke Newington police officers had been engaged in supplying drugs. The Police Federation have set aside �1m to fight allegations of corruption and are suing the Guardian and Time Out printing stories about the case.<p>
It now transpires, in an unrelated further matter, that one of the acquitted officers faces proceedings for allegedly smuggling �2.5 million worth of cannabis into the country in collusion with his father-in-law. Ooops!!<p>
*The family of Brian Douglas, who died after his skull was smashed during a struggle with police, plan to bring a private prosecution after being told that no officers are to be charged with his death. He died five days after being arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drink and drugs.</center><p>

The first nine miles of the National Cycle Network have opened! The �180 million project will create designated cycle ways, bike lanes on roads and other measures for pedal-powered vehicles linking Inverness to Cornwall via Belfast! "Only 6,491 miles to go!" said Lucy Thorp of the networks organisers Sustrans.

<a name=ARTICLE11><HR width=80% size=3><center><H3>POVERTY DOESN'T EXIST!</H3></center>
<p>

Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary has kindly decreed that Britain doesn't need a plan to tackle poverty, as it doesn't exist! He plans to back out of promises to the UN that Britain would play a part in the current International Year for the Eradication of Poverty by drawing up a national action plan. How does he draw this conclusion? By insisting that the bottom 20% have acquired more consumer goods over the past decade. More fridges, freezers, VCRs and cars obviously means that we are not poor now.
Don't be misled. These figures are generated from his own figures. The measurement of poverty in terms of availability of consumer goods is crass. Fridges don't create training, Freezers don't ensure good education, VCRs don't provide adequate health care and cars don't feed the kids. This definition of poverty is restrictive. Access to good redistribution of wealth, education, training, health care, and a definitive social structure are far more important than the acquisition of consumables.

<p>

The trial of three Lincoln people accused of refusing to leave a city warehouse roof during a road building protest was halted when magistrates walked out.<p>
The bench declared that 'the interests of justice [were] not being served' after exploding at defence lawyers cross-examining the police in a test-case of section 69 of the CJA. <p>
"Suddenly the chief magistrate told us all to stand up and gave us a bollocking, " solicitor Nick Wise told SchNEWS. "The next minute they just walked out of the courtroom. My questioning was totally fair - it's not as if the police are just going to collapse and agree with you. She just lost it."
The protesters, from the Brayford Road Action Group, cheered and shouted at the departing wigs: "We don't need you anyway!". A re-trial is set for May 7th.

<p>*** The King's Cross Women's Centre in Camden was recently evicted from its premises by ...wait for it ...a Housing Association! It wanted the centre to pay a commercial rent of �6,000 a year. The Association commented "We do not think it is our job to pay for voluntary organisations" and attacked the role of the centre for housing political views. What, like taking out the first private rape prosecution and successfully changing some of the rape laws? Meanwhile, the council have offered the Women's Centre one of their 105 empty commercial properties if they go through the grants procedures and apply for a property at the next meeting.  This is not until June, so they have a long time to wait. Call �em on 0171 624 3577 ***

Getting yer kit off to save the planet is definitely in for '96! January, and Angel bares all as the motor industry 'celebrates' 100 years of the car at Coventry Cathedral.  Next, one brave chap climbs up a tree, strips off and covers himself in grease in a bid to stop the bailiffs evicting him at Newbury. Brrr! And this week nine activists from the Lloyds and Midlands Boycott Campaign  disrupt Lloyds AGM in protest over the bank's 3rd World debt policies.   Stripping off at intervals they ran around with slogans painted on backs, breasts and buttocks such as 'Here's my ethical streak - where's yours?" and 'Expose the naked truth'.  Meanwhile, a Viz comic reader wants to get in on the naked fun.  He writes: "I am planning to celebrate 100 years of the motorcar in my bedroom on April 10th at 2.30 in the afternoon.  If any women want to come along and protest by taking their clothes off please feel free to do so." !
