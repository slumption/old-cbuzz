<font size=  +2 >What can we at cBuzz say about the SUB CAFE? It's Brighton's first ever 24-hour cafe and better than that it has decks and DJs making it the perfect after club chill out spot. I'm a little bit worried that it might prove too much of a distraction for the cBuzz crew but we are all glad it's there. If you check it out after reading this then make sure you mention it to Nick, Simon or James! You never know some of the cBuzz rabble may be in there and we'ld  be happy for you to buy us a coffee!</font><p>
