<font size=  +2 >Brighton, as any visitor, resident and Raj will know, has a thriving cafe culture. Many a day can be spent trekking from cafe to cafe - consuming enough coffee to party energetically throughout the night. We at <b>cBuzz</b> endeavour to spend as much time as we possibly can socialising in this unique environment; and therefore much of the business side of <b>cBuzz</b> takes place in many of what we regard as the better ones. So  as a result we present here to you the undisputable guide to the hippest, happenin' cafes. </font><p><HR width=75% size=20><p>
