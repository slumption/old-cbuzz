<P> Our AM <EM> i </EM> system is the market leader in this specialist area of broadcast radio transmission delivery.  In essence the system consists of a central transmitter which feeds a cable system and a number of flat panel loop antennae, each of which radiates a signal that can be picked up on a standard AM (Medium Wave) radio.  Ideal for use by major commercial sites, office blocks, hospitals, student radio services, prisons and the like.  This system offers the unique advantage of coverage that can be very accurately tailored to serve a precise area. </P>

<P> For music based services and other output requiring high quality and / or stereo output, FM 'leaky feeder' or 'Point Source Radiators' may be a viable alternative to AM <EM> i </EM>.  Contact us for more information on possible options. </P>
