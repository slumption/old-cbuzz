<P> Our Drive In Movie system is the UK market leader in this specialist area of broadcast radio transmission delivery.  In essence the system consists of a transmitter and audio processing equipment built into a trailer which also houses a 7.5 kW 35 mm platter projector.  The antenna mast is built in, located on the side of the vehicle.  Viewers simply tune in their in-car radio to pick up the soundtrack and any other broadcasts built around the film showing itself. </P>

<P> The screen is <EM> big! </EM> about 20 metres by 10 metres (60 x 30 feet) and is hoisted into position by crane, with the lowest part being some 5 or so metres above ground level.  On occasion we've had nearly 1000 cars watching at one time - so you can need a big field to fit them all in! </P>

<P> Depending upon local license conditions, we can offer stereo and mono output on both AM (C-QUAM system) and FM (Zenith GE system)  Dolby surround sound is another matter.......! </P>

<P> As a company with wide experience of event marketing world-wide Vandisplay Limited can help you with 'Drive In Movies' around the globe.  They'll take you through the whole process, advising on site selection, licence requirements, film selection and the like.</P>
