<P> We supply broadcast transmission equipment to both BBC and Independent stations in the UK, and to other stations world-wide, primarily using our own designs and those of Eddystone Radio Limited (Birmingham England) for higher power installations. </P>

<P> We can supply single items of equipment or produce a turn-key solution.  For example in one recent project we supplied a complete 5.5 kW FM stereo installation to Lusaka in Africa.  This included a full dual redundant broadcast transmitter with stereo STL (studio to transmitter link), audio processing and secondary programme feed.  </P>

The unit features optional stereo encoder and protection limiter as well as offering remote control and comprehensive metering as standard. </P>

Designed to deliver a constant 50 Watts output power with excellent long-term reliability this 3U rack mount design is ideally suited for low power repeater or commercial / community broadcasting. </P>
