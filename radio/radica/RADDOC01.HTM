<P> We supply broadcast audio processing equipment to both BBC and Independent stations in the UK, and to other stations world-wide, primarily from Inovonics Inc of Santa Cruz California USA.  We are their UK and Republic of Ireland distributor and we like their sound! </P>

<P> Quite often stations want to make their sound distinctive and Inovonics products such as the Type 250-00 FM multi-band processor allow this without over-complex digital (which often means quazi-digital but we'll put the price up anyway!) front-ends as promoted by some other companies.  European ears are different from those of our American cousins, so Radica offers a number of modification upgrades to standard units.  For example we have developed the Type 250-00 FM GFI designed for UK commercial use, often with the Type 716-00 'David II' combined digital over-shoot compensated stereo encoder and final protection limiter.  This gives results similar to those from well known alternatives - but at a more cost effective price and with less of the unwanted 'digital clipping' sounds we've come to know all too well. </P>
