<H4> Inovonics Inc. 260-00/SE: </H4>

<P> Radica Broadcast Systems have taken the tried and trusted Inovonics 260 compressor limiter and modified its performance characteristics to suit the needs of satellite radio broadcasters and signal distribution agencies.</P>

<P> The main problem with the satellite audio chain is its length and complexity!  Unless the 'envelope' of your signal leaving the studios is as clean as possible, and at just the right level, down the line it's going to get a rough ride.  Already in use by the major international satellite broadcasters, including <A HREF="http://www.wrn.org/"> 'The World Radio Network', </A> the 260-00/SE is now available for demonstration. </P>

<P> As with all Inovonics equipment, a primary design requirement is flexibity, and as a result the 260-00/SE can operate as the final level controller with a variety of other pre-processing equipment.  In particular, it is ideal for use with the highly respected Inovonics Type 250-00FM/GFI as provided by Radica Broadcast Systems Limited to numerous stations in the UK and Republic of Ireland. </P>
