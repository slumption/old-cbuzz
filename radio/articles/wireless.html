If  there's  no   wind,             hopefully there will be sun.  If we             get flat calm, overcast weather for             a week we may have to pedal.   But             one way or another, we're going to             keep the  station  afloat  without             being   dependent   on   a   mains             connection.<p>             Last year Radio Avalon consolidated             a   very   successful    overnight             sequence  of  dance/ambient  mixes             which will be back again from  the             wind-powered studio.  This is being             organised  by   Troy   Tanska   of             Stroud, currently preparing for the             Easy FM/Deep FM RSL that takes  to             the air from a local college there on             May 9.<p>             Steve  Admans,  working  for   the             BBC's   Westminster    unit,    is             organising our news team, and  for             engineering help we have two  very             experienced  engineers  -   Martin             Spencer         of         Phoenix             Communications and that old  rogue             Mike    Craig    bringing    their             considerable resources on board.<p>             As founder,  technical  chief  and             green facilities organiser I get a             number of  enquiries  from  people             hoping  to  be  able  to  help  in             exchange    for    free    passes.             Unfortunately,  not  everyone  who             wants  a  pass   will   get   one,             particularly when they are unknown             to the organisation.  It looks like             potential contributors may have to             buy their own ticket first.             There will be a  marked  shift  of             emphasis this year away  from  the             concept of a DJ sitting alone in a             portacabin behind a crash  barrier             playing his favourite records  and             reading messages  off  a  computer             screen.  Instead, for much of  the             day an 'open access'  policy  will             prevail, in that anyone who  wants             to sing, play, read a poem, tell a             story or whatever on the air will be             encouraged  to  do  so   and   the             technical  arrangements  will   be             designed with live performance as a             priority.<p>             There will also be a site-wide radio             mike able to bring  back  material             from anywhere on the  camp.    The             technical infrastructure should be             largely  in  place  by  Monday  20             June, with training and practice on             Tuesday/Wednesday prior to a  full             service  from  dawn  on   Thursday             until the following Tuesday.<p>             More info from me  at  67  Preston             Road, BRIGHTON  BN1  4QE  or  call             0273  684172  fax  0273  700  526.             Can previous enquirers  re-confirm             their interest if I haven't heard from             them lately.<p>                  <b><center>Brighton and Hove Radio<p></center></b>             Congratulations to  the  group  of             disgruntled BBC  broadcasters  who             have  -  through  an   RSL   which             started on Bank Holiday  Monday  -             reinstated a  local  service  once             provided  by  the   BBC   to   the             Brighton-to-Worthing coastal strip.<p>             With Frank Sinatra and Peggy  Lee,             discussions    about     shopping,             beggars and buses, it  is  parish-             pump local radio for  the  middle-             aged and older people who used  to             like Radio Sussex when  it  wasn't             based in far-flung Guildford.<p>             Perish the thought that it should be             the ONLY new service licensed - it             should be on AM for a start with its             high  speech   content   and   few             listeners able to hear above 6 kHz,             but it's an  obvious  and  welcome             contender for a permanent licence.<p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
