I  have             serious production difficulties with             pictures  for  inclusion  in  this             magazine.    I   would   do   more             technical talk and less anoraking if             only I could draw diagrams easily,             but  on  a  A5  page  and  lacking             suitable  software  it's  so  much             easier to tackle subjects adequate             to text only.  This  week  is  the             exception. I hope that the opposite             page will help.<p>             It's reproduced  from  a  paper  I             wrote in Wireless World, July 1983,             called Planning for Plenty, which in             turn arose out of work I had done in             1982 for  the  GLC  on  new  radio             services for London.  It  shows  a             minature lattice which could  have             been overlaid on London to produce             around     160     very      small             neighbourhood stations from  seven             unused channels.  (Unused, that is,             apart from the pirates.)<p>             There are four key features  of  a             planning lattice:<p>             (a)  the  number  of   frequencies             available;<p>             (b) the  service  radius  of  each             station,  and  by  inference   the             power;<p>             (c) the separation between stations             on the same frequency, and<p>             (d) the separation between adjacent             stations (on different frequencies).<p>               <center>  <b>LONDON LATTICE PARAMETERS</b></center><p>             In the case of the London lattice,             the parameters were:<p>             (a) 7 frequencies;<p>             (b) 2 km service radius, around 2 -             10W erp;<p>             (c) 10 km co-channel spacing;<p>             (d) 3.6 km between one station and             the next.<p>             Each little station would have been             not unlike some smaller RSL's in its             scope, and  given  the  population             density in London  most  latticees             would have had potential audiences             between   50,000    and    100,000             people, which is just about what is             currently believed to be the lower             limit of viability for a permanent             service.<p>             I  chose  seven  channels  because             with this number in a lattice  you             begin  to  get   slight   overlaps             between  the  service   areas   of             physically adjacent stations.  If you             imagine  a  one-channel   lattice,             consisting, say, only of the channel             4 stations, you can see that only a             small percentage of the land area is             covered  with  service.   As   you             increase the  number  of  channels             and fit them into the lattice, you             reach a stage  where  the  service             areas meet each  other,  and  100%             of the land area has service on at             least one frequency.<p>             Happily  one   could   fit   seven             channels  neatly  across   105-108             with comfortable 400 kHz spacing.<p>             A possible set of channels, together             with the IF offset frequencies which              must be avoided, might  look  like             the table below.<p>             Channel frequency  -  IF offset<p>             Ch 1: 105.2 MHz   -   94.5 MHz<p>             Ch 2: 105.6 MHz   -   94.9 MHz<p>             Ch 3: 106.0 MHz   -   95.3 MHz<p>             Ch 4: 106.4 MHz   -   95.7 MHz<p>             Ch 5: 106.8 MHz   -  96.1 MHz<p>             Ch 6: 107.2 MHz   -  96.5 MHz<p>             Ch 7: 107.6 MHz   - 96.9 MHz<p>             What is this 'IF offset' about? If             Radio 4 is running  on  94.5  MHz,             then almost every FM receiver will             have an  oscillator  running  10.7             MHz above  that  frequency  (105.2             MHz) when tuned to R4.  This is to             convert Radio  4  to  the  IF,  or             intermediate frequency,  which  is             always  10.7  MHz.    Mixing   two             frequencies together produces  the             sum  and  the  difference  between             them.<p>             To cut a fairly complicated  story             short, there is a risk that if two             frequencies  10.7  MHz  apart  are             radiated in  the  same  area,  and             particularly from the  same  mast,             then interference will be caused by             each to the other and quite possibly             other services as well.  There is no             REAL interaction  between  them  -             it's all done by the receiver, but it's             a fact of life and something which             has to be recognised.<p>             So we may have to offset  some  of             our channels in  areas  where  the             lower frequencies are in use.  This             is not a factor peculiar to lattice             structures - it affects ANY planning             in the 105 - 108 MHz band.   Below             is the London lattice as illustrated in             Wireless World.  More next week... <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
