If  you             have no regulation at all, you will             get a shambles, and I  have  never             advocated  this  position  for   a             moment.<p>             But at the same time, how is it that             hundreds (if not thousands) of small             stations exist in Europe, where the             laws of physics and the realities of             capitalism are no  different  from             here, but a few  hundred  are  not             viable in the UK, according  to  a             certain school of thought?<p>             All  I  understand  by  the   term             'viability' is the ability to live and             (hopefully)  thrive.      My   old             University    station     predates             commercial radio in this  area  by             seven years and is viable  in  the             sense that with all  its  ups  and             downs it is still there after eighteen             years.<p>             But it does not make any money for             executives and shareholders.   No-             one drives a BMW or goes  on  ski-             ing holidays in the winter on  the             proceeds from stations like  Radio             Falmer.  And I'm afraid that unless             a station is generating this sort of             income, it is tacitly excluded from             the 'viable' category in  official             circles.    This  is   where   the             disingenuous behaviour really lies.             It is not only small stations that can             put out hateful, socially-destructive             material - what follows is a case in             point - but at least if  they  do,             there's less potential harm than if             remarks are radiated city wide.<p>                       <b><center> Mr nasty...<p></center></b>             Last  week's  magazine  noted   in             passing a complaint upheld against             a  certain   Richard   Littlejohn,             columnist for  the  Sun,  recently             behind the mike at LBC.<p>             On  the  night  of   the   Commons             debate on the age of  consent  for             gays,  Mr  Littlejohn   apparently             voiced the following opinions - not             as a phone-in caller but as the voice             of the station - after watching TV             coverage   of   a    demonstration             outside the House:<p>             "...after  seeing   the   plankton             bouncing up and down  outside  the             Commons last night, if I  were  an             MP I'd probably have voted to raise             the   age   to   65   and   banned             moustaches and earrings as a basis             for negotiation.<p>             "Anything which that  lot  outside             the Commons are in favour of,  I'm             against in principle.  The  police             should have turned the dogs on 'em             - and, if that had failed, brought out             the flame-throwers..."<p>             Whatever  they   may   have   been             doing in Italy, Roger, it can't be             much worse than this.<p>                         <center><b>Jive Talk</b></center><p>             Listening to the pirates, it's clear             that  there  is  a  new   set   of             terminology  around  for  standard             radio   expressions.       Roughly             speaking, the basics go like this:<p>             Straight radio: "Stay tuned...             Pirate: "Keep it locked...<p>             Straight radio: "Hello to...             Pirate: "Big shout going out...<p>             Straight radio: "Greetings...             Pirate: "Big up...                     "Respect....<p>             So it's big up and respect to all you             dudes out there, keep it locked to             the wicked tunes.
