You might like             to try this connection if you have a             third speaker available to you.  It             does not have to be identical to the             other two  -  in  fact  any  small             speaker will do for a quick trial.<p>             Try playing Marvin Gaye's original             Motown recording of  "I  heard  it             through the Grapevine" through this             system, or something from a similar             era of  stereo  production.    You             might find the effect of the third             speaker quite intriguing.<p>             This connection relies  on  giving             added prominence to the difference             components to enhance  the  stereo             effect.  If the source is in mono, the             rear speaker should fall completely             silent.  So it is  with  our  solo             connection of one speaker.<p>             If  you  switch  to  mono  on  the             amplifier or tuner, you should hear             virtually nothing coming out of the             difference speaker.  If you have a             balance control, moving it from side             to side will cause the volume to rise             at each extreme to  normal  level,             and cancel out at or very near the             centre.<p>             Go easy on the  volume  control  -             don't advance it any  higher  than             you would for normal listening.             The difference  signal  is  almost             always much quieter than  the  sum             signal, but it is still being produced             from full-amplitude excursions from             each  of  your   power   amplifier             stages.  You ought not to  advance             the volume control so much, in your             enthusiasm to hear small difference             signals, that you drive the output             stages  of  your  amplifier   into             clipping.<p>             So what are we listening to?  With             FM  radio,  it's   a   demodulated             version of a signal which, while it             was winging its way  to  you,  was             riding aboard  a  supersonic  sub-             carrier centred on 38 kHz on top of             the normal mono modulation.   This             signal is  not  detected  by  mono             receivers, or stereo sets switched             to mono.  The amount of difference             signal is a guide to the amount of             stereo  effect  in  the  programme             material.<p>             If there is no difference signal apart             from noise and distortion, then the             programme  material  is  in   mono             whatever the lights or  indicators             may say on your receiver.<p>             A few years ago, the  BBC  started             putting out the pilot tone on Radio             4 FM continuously,  regardless  of             whether  the  programme   was   in             stereo or not.  Similarly, all  TV             NICAM decoders  light  a  'stereo'             beacon   whenever   they   get   a             NICAM   signal,   regardless    of             whether or not the contents of left             and right channels are  identical.             With the 'difference'  connection,             you  can  hear  exactly  how  much             stereo you are really getting  for             your money.<p>             Beware,  however,   of   some   FM             tuners  which  have  a  'hi-blend'             system  to   reduce   the   stereo             separation  (and  noise)  at  high             frequencies on weak stations,  and             can't always be turned off...  This             can mislead you into thinking there             is less 'difference' than is actually             broadcast,  and   may   make   the             difference   signal   possess    a curiously muffled tonal balance.<p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
