And  it  does   leave   me             wondering about the future of radio             in  the  hands  of   the   younger             generation.<p>             Essentially, Freedom's programming             aims are very modest, - a far  cry             from the elaborate ambitions of the             late-lamented Festival Radio.  It is a             dance music station, and no  more.             To describe it as a 'pirate with a             licence' fairly sums it up.<p>                    <b><center>Wannabes and Pirates</center></b><p>             DJ's fall mainly into two types: (a)             commercial radio wannabes and  (b)             pirates.    The  wannabes   appear             during the day.  They  have  heard             what conventional ILR stations do,             and aim to imitate it in every detail.             Perhaps this is the only sort of radio             outside the BBC that they have ever             been  exposed  to,  and  so   they             imagine this is the only  possible             approach to the medium.<p>             Anyway,  the   usual   assumptions             prevail.  The audience is mentally             deficient  and  for  one   DJ   in             particular,   suffering   from   a             complete  absence  of   short-term             memory capacity. "Don't forget thecompetition  -  don't  forget  the             number to call - don't forget that             so-and-so is coming up  after  the             news - don't  forget  to  take  an             umbrella when it rains etc. etc.<p>             Of course a lot of his audience IS             mentally deficient.    They  would             have to be to put up with this tosh             for any length of time, and it is,             after all, axiomatic that half the             population  is  of  below  average             intelligence.    But   while   the             professional patter may from  time             to time serve  some  informational             purpose, the amateur version lacks             the  external  input  that   makes             regular ILR an  acceptably  useful             background noise.<p>             The 'pirate' category of DJ has  a             different approach.  Not for him the             niceties  of  mike  technique   or             received pronunciation.  He will not             remind you to remember  things  it             wouldn't matter if you forgot:  not             for him the unctuous  attempts  at             charm and cheery helpfulness.<p>             No, the pirate just shouts at you.             He is not aware that  advances  in             microphone  technology   make   it             possible  to  pick  up  a  whisper             several feet away.  He behaves  as             if the microphone had been plugged             into a line input on the  desk  by             mistake, and consequently needs  a             bit of heavy driving.<p>             It is  unfortunate  that  so  many             young DJ's learn  their  trade  in             noisy, crowded night  clubs  where             no-one can hear themselves  think.             There they pick up all sorts of bad             habits from the radio point of view.             Perhaps there ought to be remedial             classes for club DJ's, to  impress             upon them, above all, that radio is a             one-to-one medium,  so  that  they             should not behave as if they  were             addressing  a  crowd,  but   treat             listeners as individuals who are not             hard of hearing.<p>             All praise, though, to the DJ  who             puts together the ambient show  on             Sunday night.   Ambient  DJ's  are             sensitive to sound  texture:  they             know that a valuable dimension  to             programme flow is light and  shade             or dynamic contrast, and it is very             pleasant to be treated to music that             is not peaking 6 all the time  and             isn't chopped up into  four-minute             segments....<p>                <b><center>  Virgin on the Ridiculous</center></b><p>             Talking  of  light  and  shade  or             dynamic   contrast,   our    cable             company  have  recently  put   the             Virgin satellite feed onto  an  FM             carrier.  Does Virgin sound good in             FM stereo?  No, sir,  it  doesn't.             Once more the lunatics have  taken             over the Optimod.  Do not waste  a              network on  these  morons.    They             don't know what quality sound <b>IS</b>. <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
