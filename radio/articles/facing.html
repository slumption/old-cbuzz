There  is  some             fascinating information to be found             if you know where to look for it.<p>             The enclosed is an excerpt from  a             discussion between  two  Americans             on an international bulletin board             debating the future  of  broadcast             radio I pulled off-line a few weeks             ago:<p>             "... We're each a part of lots of different             audiences.  In the great Venn Diagram of             life, my various tastes overlap with the             tastes of many other people.  Just maybe,             there's a way  to  create  my  own             'programming' and get it to the other             people who would enjoy it in some way             that makes me a profit.<p>             "If radio can't do what we want it to, we             should each try to invent or co-opt some             other medium.  My Honda  won't  go             off-road, but I don't curse it out. Instead I             get a mountain bike or  borrow  my             brother-in-law's Jeep.  The kids in Santa             Cruz who are loading sound and album-art             files onto the Internet are trying to design             their own 'off-road vehicle'.  I just want to             see more people acknowledge the realities             of capitalism and physics and then create             better, more economical machines to             connect talented artists with appreciative             audiences..."<p>             "Very interesting observation, and one that             those of us in the radio biz would just as             soon not even think about.  Radio - due to             its built-in limitations - has never been able             to please all of the people all of the time,             and success has been achieved by devising             various ways to keep people listening             despite the fact that what they're hearing             is not 100% to their liking.<p>             "Everything that a modern PD does:             contests, promotions, music scheduling -             everything - is oriented toward this goal. If             the digital phone/computer-network/cable             revolution that has begun in the past few             years results - as so many of us think/hope             that it will - in the ability to micro-target             audiences of a few tens of thousands             spread out worldwide profitably with             programming that does satisfy that             audience nearly 100% of the time, and if             consumers are - through interactive media             services - able to program their own             customized versions of audio/video             services, then where does that leave             mass-market broadcasters?<p>             "When I was growing up, my peers and I             would spend every Sunday night glued to             the TV in the hopes of getting a glimpse of             our rock & roll idols on Ed Sullivan. Imagine             today's kids - with 24 hour access to MTV             - sitting still for hour after hour of acrobats,             spoon-players, and mouse handpuppets in             order to see a couple of rock videos.  Well,             folks, it seems  to  me  that  the             fragmentation & narrowcasting that we             hear on the FM dial today is just the             beginning.<p>             "Yet I attended one of the world's biggest             radio conventions recently, and the subject             of new-tech radio alternatives never even             came up. Even DMX - the forerunner of             even more specialized services to come -             and one that is already in place in most             urban areas - wasn't discussed. Everyone             seemed to assume that what has worked in             the past will always continue to work, and             that the only competition they needed to             worry about was the FM station across             town.<p>             "How do I think radio can respond to the             changes that are sure to come? I don't             know, but I'll bet that a  locally             programmed,   audience-responsive,             idiosyncratic, unpredictable, musically             adventurous station would have a better             shot at hanging onto its audience that one             that was programmed strictly by national             charts, dependent upon syndicated features             & personalities, and "safe" in its             presentation..."<p>             A  'locally  programmed,  audience             responsive,         idiosyncratic,             unpredictable,          musically-             adventurous station?  What a great             idea!  The nearest we have to that             format in this location  is, however,             a pirate... <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
