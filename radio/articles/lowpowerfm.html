There is a yawning chasm             between the two in both  financial             and technical terms, and a lot  of             frustration from RSL operators who             wish dearly to be able to carry on             after the 28-day deadline expires.<P>             What  we  have  been  offered   is             pretty damn  close  to  the  right             answer on the face of it. After the             DTI   Radiocommunications   Agency             has   assessed    the    technical             feasibility of the proposed system a             frequency (usually 87.7 MHz)  will             be assigned to the service and the             licensee-designate given authority             to operate the station for a twelve             month period.<P>             Following  confirmation  from  the             Radio  Authority  that   continued             operation of the service is OK and             the station has complied with all the             rules, a five-year licence will then             be offered to the  station.    The             Radio  Authority  will  have   the             discretion to renew the licence at             five-yearly intervals thereafter.<P>             So far so good.  But when I look at             the other strings attached to this             offer, I begin to  wonder  if  the             person drafting the regulations lives             in the real world or some sort  of             'Alice in Wonderland' fantasy.  For             a start, licences are only available in             certain remote parts of the country,             notwithstanding that frequencies in             the 107 - 108 MHz  band  have  all             been specifically set aside for them.             The   map   showing   the    areas             privileged enough to have this offer             made to  them  is  supplied.    It             includes most of Scotland  outwith             the central belt, the Lake District,             much of rural Wales, and the south-             west of England.  There is also  a             tiny patch around  Scarborough  in             Yorkshire.<P>             A phrase familiar to those  of  us             who   have   wrestled   with   the             inductive loop specification crops             up in  section  5  of  the  notes.             &quot;Emissions  (it  says)  shall   be             restricted  to  ensure  that  they             cannot  be  effectively   received             beyond the limit of the curtilage of             the establishment or  premises  to             which the licence relates.&quot;  Under             section 4, however, it admits that             with just 50 mW &quot;it is unlikely that             a good or even adequate signal will             be   received    throughout    the             establishment is concerned.&quot;<P>             Both assertions are ridiculous.  It is             impossible to restrict VHF radiation             to the &quot;curtilage&quot; of any  set  of             premises.   Sensitive  tuners  are             available which will give solid mono             copy with about three microvolts of             signal,   and   so   a    50    mW             transmission  can   be   heard   -             admittedly only with good  quality             receivers - more than a mile  away             under line-of-sight conditions.  I             should know because I've tried  it             and so have Wireless  Workshop  in             their  tests  on  leaky   feeders.             Confining VHF/FM transmissions  to             a  specific  set  of  premises  is             impossible.<P>             Furthermore, 50 mW is not going to             be  enough  to  cover  a  set   of             premises such as a hospital  where             there are more and more  computers             and other  RF-noisy  equipment  in             use.  To permit stereo operation at             this power level is just asking for             trouble.  Alan Brown  of  Wireless             Workshop  (who  have  considerable             experience with AM inductive  loop             systems) says that the  low  power             and lack of interference protection             is going  to  cause  any  would-be             contractor no end of hassle. <P>             When people pay money for a  radio             transmission system they expect it             to work 24 hours a day  7  days  a             week 52 weeks a year.    Induction             loop AM systems such  as  the  one             sold by Wireless Workshop  deliver             this and can be effectively confined             to a specific set of premises.<P>             I would allow FOUR  watt  licences             to be issued in the 107 - 108  MHz             band and planned on the  basis  of             MONO operation.   They  should  be             forbidden to run stereo because it             makes planning criteria much  more             stringent.  But licences should be             available on the same basis and on             the  same  terms  as  the  current             option.<P>             All I am asking for is the power of a             legal Citizen's Band (CB) radio rig- a             mere four watts, because I believe             that this level of power would  be             unlikely to cause interference  to             other services any more than legal             CB rigs do.<P>             There should be restrictions on the             maximum  EHAAT  (effective  height             above  average  terrain)  and  the             aerial height should  be  no  more             than 15m above ground level  using             a vertically polarised omnidirectional             dipole aerial.  Any student, hospital             or other organisation should be able             to apply for a four watt licence and             this  should  be  available  on  a             nationwide basis.<P>             Stations should be protected  from             each other by  a  simple  rule-of-             thumb separation and  they  should             be encouraged to use aerials at the             foot of valleys (thereby  covering             the slopes of the valley  but  not             much more) in order to minimise the             'impact area' around the transmitter             where  the  frequency  in  use  is             effectively 'sterilised'.<P>             After all, we were told after  the             consultation sham that 107  -  108             MHz was going to be available  for             small stations.  Well then.  Where             are these small stations?  Shall we             just leave 107 - 108 for the pirates?<p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
