There is  the             world of music recording: studios,             vast mixing  desks,  sophisticated             recording media.  There is the arena             of  public  address  systems   and             sound  reinforcement,  stacks   of             speakers,  amps  and   more   vast             desks.   There  is  the  world  of             broadcasting     and     programme             distribution, radio, TV, video, cable,             satellite.  And finally, there is the             consumer    industry,     whatever             people have at home to listen to the             final product.<p>             About twenty-five years ago,  when             I  first  became  aware  of  these             distinctions, there was much  more             common   ground    between    them             than there is now.  For one thing,             there was an important UK industry             making a local contribution in all             four arenas.  But more than  that,             when it came to setting  standards             and striving for progress, there was             a measure of agreement  about  how             to proceed.<p>             Each discipline recognised the same             authorities, and talked  much  the             same language, so  that  engineers             and designers could move from  one             area to another without feeling out             of place.  Not any more.  People in             each   area   go   to    different             exhibitions,    read     different             magazines, inhabit a technological             landscape which is very much their             own territory.<p>             Take loudspeakers.  List the  most             respected equipment in the context             of (a) recording studio monitors, (b)             PA   stacks,   (c)   broadcasters'             monitors  or  (d)  domestic  hi-fi             speakers.      Maybe   some    BBC             monitors overlap (c) and (d), maybe             Messrs. Tannoy pop up   more  than             once, but there will not  be  much             overlap these  days.    Does  this             matter?  Is  separate  development             good for the end product?<p>                    <center><b>Feedback is fertile</b></center><p>             Well, I think it might speed up the             learning  curve  if  we  had  more             cross-fertilisation of ideas.  At the             moment, for example, people in the             hi-fi industry  have  a  very  low             opinion of the standards  of  most             broadcasting.  At the  same  time,             the broadcasters fall about laughing             at the people who spend  199 on  a             set of 'oxygen-free copper'  audio             connecting leads with  gold-plated             plugs each end in the belief  that             this is justified in terms of improved             sound quality. (Me - I don't laugh.  I             want to be  introduced  to  people             who have that  sort  of  money  to             spend...)<p>             But it is true that many broadcasts             do sound pretty  disgusting  on  a             good hi-fi system,  when  compared             with the original recording in all its             glory.  And it is also true that real             hi-fi (often British made) continues             to set standards against which your             Dixons music centre hardly  passes             muster.<p>             But no-one is listening.  Remember             that nominations for the (a)  best             and (b) worst  audio  quality  you             have  ever  experienced  from  the             radio are always  accepted.    Any             station - present or  past  -  can             qualify.   Fax  your  comments  to             0273 700 526 any time.<p>                       <b><center>News in Brief<p></center></b>             A group has been  formed  here  in             Brighton to press our local  cable             company - Nynex - to start a proper             local service on  their  so-called             'community' channel.<p>             Local radio and television is the one             thing which cable can offer  which             satellite services manifestly can't,             yet Nynex has so far proved  quite             impervious to suggestions that the             current slide-and-caption  service             should be replaced with  something             more lively and interesting.  Yet a             good local channel could  actually              boost cable take-up.  What is  the             matter with these cable people? <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
