This is (L - R) and is             transmitted supersonically between             23 and 53 kHz.  All you have to do             to hear what it sounds like is  to             disconnect the speakers from  your             stereo system, and then  reconnect             one of the  speakers  between  the             'hot' (red) terminals of the left and             right channels (either way round).<p>             In the vast majority of amplifiers             where   the   speakers   share   a             common earth, this will reveal the             difference signal in all its glory.  In             the minority  of  amplifiers  with             bridged  output  stages,  you  may             need to connect the other  speaker             between the earth terminals to get             the effect.<p>             To check the  system  is  working,             switch your  tuner  to  mono,  and             almost  all   the   sound   should             disappear (there will always be  a             little leakage due  to  not-quite-             perfect gain matching between left             and right).  In stereo, you should             hear some of the music but virtually             nothing from the DJ (since they are             almost always centre-injected, and             cancel out).   Most  records  will             sound peculiar in difference mode.<p>                   <center>How stereo is stereo?</center><p>             This technique can be  applied  to             any stereo source, not just radio, to             see how much use is  made  of  the             stereo domain.  I have sat through             our    regional    BBC-TV     news             programme which trumpets itself as             being in 'stereo' before it starts.<p>             In fact, there is no difference signal             at all (i.e. the programme  is  in             mono) except during  the  'stings'             played  in  between   items,   and             during the weather forecast, where             the presenter stands to the right of             the map, and is duly panned across.<p>             Similarly, BBC local radio transmits             little if any  stereo  information             during  most  speech  programming.             Almost  everything  on  our  local             service is centre-injected, and the             only time the difference channel is             activated is on the rare  occasion             when a record or promo is played.<p>             Perhaps someone  at  the  BBC  can             try to justify why BBC local radio             needs stereo FM at all, given that             the stereo effect is redundant and             unused for so much  of  the  time.             And the only effect of having  the             red light on, as far as the listener is             concerned, is  to  make  reception             more noisy and distorted  than  it             needs to be!<p>             One   thing   you   will    notice             immediately about  the  difference             signal is that if normal FM reception             is noisy,  somewhat  distorted  or             subject   to   interference,   the             difference signal will sound  much             worse.<p>             And   you    may    also    detect             production distortions  which  are             normally masked by the sum signal.             Anything  that's  been  through  a             digital   bit-scrambling   process             (politely known as compression) will             often sound strange as a difference             component, particularly if attempts             have  been  made  to  exploit  the             alleged    'redundancy'    between             components of a stereo pair. <p>  Can              YOU hear the difference? <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
