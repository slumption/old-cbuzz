Unlike  other  hi-fi             reviewers,  I  make  a  point   of             measuring the frequency  response,             distortion and noise from  the  AM             section of the apparatus.<p>             The  conclusion  I  draw  from  my             measurements is  that  almost  all             commercially-available product is a             disgrace   when   it   comes    to             reproducing  AM  radio.    The  AM             sections is even quite fancy tuners             are token gestures with no serious             engineering effort applied.  And it             shows.<p>             What's galling is that  the  extra             parts needed to make a substantial             improvement  in   AM   performance             are not expensive  -  a  few  quid             spent on a better  IF  filter  and             proper audio filtering with a notch             at  9  kHz  would  make   such   a             difference.<p>             I have modified commercial  tuners             to improve their  AM  performance.             In particular, I have opened up the             frequency response from the dismal             3 kHz that is normally  about  the             limit of effective reproduction to the             6 kHz that is actually transmitted.<p>             The difference is like  chalk  and             cheese.  You see, there is nothing             inherent  in  the   AM   broadcast             process  that  need  produce   any             more distortion than a typical  FM             path.  And AM  signals  give  more             solid coverage and penetration than             FM.  They degrade more  gracefully             when the signal  fades,  and  they             can be received in locations  like             basement flats where FM often fails             miserably.<p>               <center>Appropriate programming for AM</center><p>             The suggestion that current 'Gold'             services should shift from  AM  to             FM doesn't make  technical  sense.             Those of us who were listening  to             pop radio in the sixties and early             seventies   were   almost   always             listening on AM.<p>             Our recollection of the  music  is             based on hearing it through the AM             medium - from the sixties pirates,             RNI, or  the  247-metre  Radio  1.             When the same tracks are heard  on             a compact disc  latter-day  remake             they simply don't sound right.  The             whole balance has been altered, the             melody is less prominent  and  the             clinical nature of CD often reveals             deficiencies in the recording or the             mix  which  AM  broadcast  happily             glosses over.<p>             There are clearly formats suited to             AM and formats which are not.   It             seems bizarre, for instance , that             London has a talk service on  97.3             MHz, where stereo is  a  waste  of             time and intelligibility rather than hi-             fi is the requirement, while the new             country music service has to  make             do  with  AM.     I   also   can't             understand why more people  aren't             pressing for BBC local radio - rightly             proud of its high speech content -             to be shifted from FM to AM  where             it belongs.<p>             What  about  community  radio   on             AM?    There  are  objections   on             grounds of cost and site selection,             although work  is  being  done  by             some   companies   on   ways   and             means  of  engineering  low   cost             transmission sites.<p>             I do remember  that  twenty  years             ago  pirates  like  Radio   Jackie             managed  to  put  out  useful   AM             signals without  mortgaging  their             homes in the  process,  and  radio             amateurs can send a few  watts  on             'top band' (1.8 -  2.0MHz)  within             amateur budgets too.  So  although             FM will be the preferred option for             most community services I wouldn't             rule it out altogether.  <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
