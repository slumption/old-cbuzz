The  Beta   system             shifted millions of VCR's, not  so             much in the UK but certainly in the             US,  and   was   responsible   for             bringing video  recording  to  the             home  for  the  first  time  on  a             significant scale.  I don't think DAB             will be anything like as successful;<p>             Q2: (b) is the correct answer.  See             the discussion on stereo in  Issue             92;<p>             Q3: (c) is about the limit.  I counted             over forty stations in a hotel room             in Paris last time I was there seven             years ago, and there wasn't a  lot             going on above 105 MHz  then.    I             don't  know  how   many   of   the             stations I could hear were legal, but             they were all clear reception on a             my reasonable but  hardly  opulent             travelling radio;<p>             Q4: (d) 1593 kHz  is  the  one  to             watch;<p>             Q5: (c) 20m has been permitted  to             FM RSL's  in  most  places  on  an             experimental basis since  January,             and  my  latest  chat  with   Prem             Mangat at the DTI reveals that  in             future stations will all be able to             apply for this height, though with             no guarantee that they will get as             much  power  as  they  would  have             got at 10m;<p>             Q6: (c)  The Virgin relay at Lydd in             Kent uses the unusual frequency of             1224  kHz,  adjacent  to  the  big             network channel of 1215 kHz;<p>             Q7: (c)  The pre-emphasis required             by FM transmissions amounts  to  a             boost  of  10.32  dB  at  10   kHz             relative to 315 Hz, if you want to             be precise  about  it.    This  is             otherwise    known    as     fifty             microseconds;<p>             Q8: (a)  Yes, the first-ever  RSL,             then known as Special Event Radio,             took place at the Greenbelt Festival             in  Northamptonshire   in   August             1984 with  a  power  so  low  that             anywhere else it could  have  been             written off as a spurious emission             from a high-power transmitter.<p>             We  actually  thought   they   had             slipped a decimal  point  when  we             saw it. For all that, 50mW produces             a  surprising  2mV/m  at   a   1km             radius, just  enough  for  daytime             reception with  a  following  wind             within a small  camp.    And  it's             cheap;<p>             Q9: (b) The bandwidth of legal  AM             transmissions in the UK  is  never             more than 6.5  kHz,  and  in  some             cases less.   Other  broadcasters,             particularly in  Southern  Europe,             Africa and the  USA  broadcast  10             kHz  of  audio,  sometimes   more.             This results in US AM quality being             half-way between  our  AM  and  FM             in quality terms, making it a more             serious contender in a competitive             market.<p>             Widening the bandwidth will  allow             better AM  audio  quality  at  the             expense    of     adjacent-channel             interference.  I am not  convinced             that current arrangements in the UK             are optimal - daytime services  in             many   areas   could   run    more             bandwidth  without   causing   any             grief;<p>             Q10: (b)  The bandwidth on  FM  is             limited by the Zenith stereo system             to about 15  kHz,  allowing  elbow             room for the pilot tone at 19 kHz. <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
