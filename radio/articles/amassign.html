Together  with   the             external services transmissions on             1296 kHz,  they  emerge  today  as             the ONLY  channels  where  the  UK             has  a  high-power   international             allocation capable of fitting in high-             power regional or national network             services.  The old  regional  Home             Service variations vanished in the             early seventies, and there  was  a             further major reshuffle  in  1978.<p>             Today the pack emerges like this:<p>             World Service:  648 kHz (was 464m)<br>             Radio 5 live :  693 kHz (was 434m)<br>             R Scotland   :  810 kHz (was 371m)<br>             R Wales      :  882 kHz (was 341m)<br>             Radio 5 live :  909 kHz (was 330m)<br>             Radio 1      : 1053 kHz (was 285m)<br>             Radio 1      : 1089 kHz (was 275m)<br>             Misc ILR     : 1152 kHz (was 261m)<br>             Virgin       : 1215 kHz (was 247m)<br>             Radio Ulster : 1341 kHz (was 224m)<br>             Misc ILR/BBC : 1458 kHz (was 206m)<br>             Misc ILR/BBC : 1548 kHz (was 194m)<p>             You can see that the frequencies of             1152,   1458   and    1548    kHz,             originally 261, 206 and 194 metres,             are high-power channels reassigned             to so-called local radio, but still             used by high  power  transmitters.             The  London  services   on   these             channels burn 25, 50  and  100  kW             EMRP respectively.<p>             All other  frequencies,  with  the             exception of 1485, 1584  and  1602             kHz, are assigned  to  some  other             country for high  power  use,  and             can only be  used  in  the  UK  by             stations of a sufficiently low power             (no more than 1 or 2  kW)  not  to             cause interference to the  foreign             service.<p>             The  three  exceptions   mentioned             above are universal    Europe-wide             low-power channels for 1 or  2  kW             transmitters  with  no  high-power             assignments   anywhere.       This             doesn't  always  make  them   much             quieter at night, as the number of             transmitters in use is quite high.<p>             To  cover  London  well  needs   a             transmitter capable of at least, say,             2mV/m field  strength  50km  away.             The amount of power  necessary  is             little more than 1 kW at the  very             bottom of the dial (where Spectrum             is fortunate to find itself) but rises             rapidly to around 5 kW  about  800             kHz, 20 kW just above  1  MHz  and             as much as 100 kW at  the  top  of             the dial.  It's not easy to  serve             London in one go without using  up              a high-power UK channel... <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
