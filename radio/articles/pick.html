Make  contact             in the first instance on the calling             channel, then nominate one of  the             other 39 frequencies to  carry  on             your chat.<p>             It's a completely autonomous, self-             organising system which caters for             a pool of users  with  a  pool  of             frequencies one of which they  may             want to use for a short period at a             time.  If you have interference on             one channel, you hop  up  or  down             until you find a clear opening.  The             same self-assignment practice  also             applies (within agreed band-plans)             on the amateur radio bands.<p>             A similar administration-free policy             works for cordless telephones - the             eight   channels   for    analogue             cordless phones  are  assigned  at             random as the sets come out of the             box.  Some  new  units  offer  the             option  of  switching  frequencies             around to find the clearest one at             your location now that the channels             are becoming heavily  loaded,  but             the  basic  principle   of   self-             management applies.<p>             The     reason      why      these             arrangements are in place is that it             would be a bureaucratic  nightmare             to organise things any other  way.             With  many  thousands   of   users             spending less than   100  each  on             equipment, the paperwork  involved             in  formally  planning  everyone's             frequency use would cost far  more             than the sets themselves, which is             crazy.  The simplest thing to do is             to set the technical limits within             which  legal  operation  can  take             place, award a pool of frequencies             to the service, and let the  users             sort them out amongst themselves.<p>             More sophisticated sets,  such  as             cellular telephones, find and assign             themselves clear frequencies totally             automatically,  without  the  user             even being aware of the process.<p>                      <b><center>Self-management</center></b><p>             The  examples  I   have   so   far             discussed are  the  most  dramatic             examples of  self-management,  but             in fact these days more  than  50%             of the total number of radio licences             (for various purposes) issued by the             Radiocommunications   Agency   are             handled by  contracted-out  bodies             looking  after  the  interests  of             specific user groups.  In general this             works well.<p>             I have  always  been  struck,  for             instance, by the very cost-effective             and efficient  way  in  which  ASP             handle  link  frequency  licences.             Four weeks' use of a link frequency             is usually a very  straightforward             matter of telling  them  what  you             want  and  where  and   when   you             want it, and sending off a  cheque             for  160.  Compare that  with  the             cost  and  rigmarole  involved  in             getting  the  DTI   to   award   a             frequency in the broadcast band in             similar circumstances.<p>             Now  the   Radio   Authority   has             decided to opt for  Option  D  for             using 105 -  108  MHz.    Although             the majority of  submissions  (250             out of 450) favoured some form  of             small-scale radio development, only             a third of the new spectrum (107 -             108  MHz)  is   now   specifically             assigned to that purpose.<p>             But within that slice of spectrum,             there could be  as  many  would-be             operators  as  there  are  at  the             moment in all the local radio sub-             bands put together.  I  wonder  if             there would be any mileage in  the             idea that - as Annan put it  years             ago "a different  animal  needs  a             different keeper".<p>             Were legislation to recognise a new             layer of broadcasting intermediate             between current RSL's  and  eight-             year full-time licences, a fair and             independent   body   sorting   out             frequency assignment in this sector             might be able  to  streamline  the             process to the satisfaction of users             and Government alike. <p><p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
