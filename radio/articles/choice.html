Admittedly             between them there  are  only  ten             different programmes, there  being             four transmitters carrying identical             BBC local radio programming, three             for Southern FM, and two for Radio             Mercury.<p>             But officially I have been reminded             that  (God  Forbid)  I   am   only             supposed to be  listening  to  two             services - BBC  Radio  Sussex-and-             Surrey and Southern FM.    Indeed,             for your  average  punter  with  a             clock radio in a basement flat, that             is all he or she will be able to get             apart from the  national  networks             unless an RSL comes along.  I  can             well understand the lack of appeal             radio has for many of  my  friends             when I realise how little choice it             has to offer them unless they invest             in a serious receiving installation.<p>             What is being admitted is that in a             total of six megahertz of spectrum,             only  two   services   are   being             officially provided to most of the             population.  Further, most of  the             options for 105 - 108 MHz  promise             only one more service  in  another             three megahertz of dial space.  Can             this be right? Is  eight  services             across twenty megahertz the limit?                     <p> <b>A load of balls</b><p>             The situation is like a rectangular             tank filled to the brim with round             balls of  various  sizes  above  a             certain minimum.   Ostensibly  the             tank is full, in that if the lid is put             on the balls reach right to the top.             But in fact there is room for more             balls to be put into the tank if the             minimum size is reduced.    Little             balls   can   slide   around   the             interstices between larger ones, so             that the total capacity of the tank             increases if the minimum ball size is             lowered.<p>             This is the situation, not in the as-             yet  unexploited  105  -  108  MHz             band, but in much of  the  network             and local radio sub-bands used right             now.    For  instance,  the  BBC's             national   network   transmissions             appear to sterilise 2.2 MHz worth of             spectrum for each service - a strong             argument for moving  them  off  FM             and onto  DAB  if  and  when  that             service reaches a majority audience.<p>             But usually there is just one major             transmitter  responsible  for  the             service to a particular community,             and so only that transmitter needs             to be protected from interference.             Low-power  transmitters  occupying             the frequency of out-of-area major             network transmitters will  deprive             no-one  of  the   wanted   network             service and can be planned not  to             interfere with the distant transmitter             inside its own  coverage  area  by             virtue of the imbalance of powers.<p>             Similarly, in the local radio sub-             band, if only two services can  be             expected  across   two   sub-bands             each three  megahertz  wide,  then             only  those   two   need   to   be             protected     against     incoming             interference, and  there  is  some             scope for new stations of at least             RSL levels of substance to run co-             channel with out-of-area stations.<p>             So, as an aside to the whole  105-             108 debate, I  would  submit  that             claims that all  existing spectrum is             fully saturated are exaggerated. <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
