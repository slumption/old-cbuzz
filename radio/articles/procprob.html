I would have liked a fortnight             so that I had as long to de-bug the             system as I had to build it, but this             was not how it turned out.  The last             soldered joint  was  made  at  11-             15pm, and the station was  on  the             air at midnight.<p>             Needless to say  there  were  some             problems to sort out, involving the             uniquely nerve-wracking process of             making modifications to a desk that             is live on the air.  But I enjoy a             challenge like this, and something             that struck me straight  away  was             the difficulty of processing modern             dance music given the  constraints             of the FM broadcast system.<p>             Let's  just  be  clear  what   the             restraints are.  On FM  broadcasts             you are allowed at most +/- 75 kHz             deviation      independent      of             modulating frequency.  But all  FM             receivers have significant treble cut,             known   as   de-emphasis.      The             response of an FM radio is about 3             dB down at 3 kHz,  and  more  than             10 dB down above 10  kHz.    So  a             flat, unequalised  signal,  passed             through   a   limiter   into   the             transmitter, will sound muffled and             murky when received.<p>             It is necessary  to  provide  pre-             emphasis (treble boost) to  ensure             that the response of the system is             flat across the audio band.    But             immediately we have a problem.  If             we put the pre-emphasis before the             limiter, the limiter will be receiving a             highly treble-boosted signal,  and             will produce strange effects.<p>                    <b><center>Trouble with treble<p></center></b>             Particularly on material like dance             music, the treble-boosted signal will             often have more energy in  the  HF             end of the spectrum than  anywhere             else. We are all used  to  hearing             limiters riding gain on the bass, and             while this can be unwelcome it is a             familiar  sound  and  not   wholly             objectionable.  Limiters riding on             the treble, however, sound terrible.<p>             So if  instead  we  put  the  pre-             emphasis after the limiter and just             before the transmitter input, we will             not get funny effects.    But  the             limiter will be unable to control the             maximum deviation at the  top  end             of  the  spectrum  with  the  pre-             emphasis applied.  If set for 75 kHz             deviation   at    mid-band,    the             maximum possible deviation  at  15             kHz would  be  about  14  dB  more             than that.  In other words,  there             would  be  nothing  to  stop   the             boosted treble from  overdeviating             on treble energy to a large extent,             causing sibilance and splatter.<p>             In practice the  problem  is  less             serious than it sounds -  on  most             material the excess is rarely more             than 6dB.  But still  there  is  a             problem. If the drive is backed off             so that no over-deviation  occurs,             the audio level will be far too low in             the rest of the spectrum.<p>             The  answer  is   some   sort   of             automatic   pre-emphasis,    which             controls the treble boost separately             from the overall level in such a way             that were there to be  a  risk  of             overdeviation, the HF energy will be             backed off  momentarily  and  then             immediately restored when  the  HF             transient has passed.  Done  well,             this process can be almost inaudible             and is standard  practice  in  all             professional broadcast operations.<p>             It is possible to go  further  and             introduce a circuit which can boost             pre-emphasis as well as cut it  to             even out  the  difference  between              bright and dull material arriving at             the transmitter.
