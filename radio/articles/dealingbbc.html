I    was             preparing a soft  rebuke  for  the             Community    Radio    Association,             some  of  you  (and  indeed   even             some  of  them)  may  already   be             aware of.  I wished  a  mild  lack             of  attention  to  detail  on  the             part of the CRA  to  be  drawn  to             the  attention  of   a   gentleman             called Nick Higham.<p>             Now  I'm  sure  I  don't  need  to             tell too many  of  you  what  Nick             does,  but  for  the  benefit   of             those   people   like   the    BBC             switchboard  staff   who   haven't             a  clue  who  he  is,  Nick  deals             with   media,   and   of    course             RADIO stories  for  that  flagship             broadcast    known    colloquiallyas  'The  Nine  o'clock  News'  on             the telly.<p>             I've known Nick for years...             I used  to  write  years  ago  the             usual     column     of      self-             opinionated   rubbish    on    the             back  of  his  shaky  Radio  Month             operation   until    it    folded.             Owing  me  money,  it  has  to  be             said.<p>             Now   although    nowadays    Nick             and  I  have  had   contact   with             each  other  amounting  to  little             more  than  a   dozen   words   in             the past five years, it's a  plain             fact of life  that  no  journalist             forgets  his  first   relationship             with  an  editor  worthy  of   the             name.    However  much,  I   might             add,  the  latter,  now  that   he             has    reached    such    elevated             heights   of   importance,   might             appear  on  the  face  of  it   to             have no desire to reciprocate.<p>             Anyway,  having  a  juicy   little             press  release  and   sending   to             the   snooty   old   duffer    can             hardly be a bad idea, can it.    I             knew   that   Nick   was   in   TV             centre   somewhere   and   I   was             also  convinced  that   he   could             hardly  be  so  far  from  a   fax             machine  that  if  one   came   in             with    his    name    prominently             marked  about   it   another   BBC             employee   might   possibly   draw             it to his attention before it  got             too  late  to  be  useful.  So   I             approached  the   BBC   with   the             following (to me at least)  fairly             straightforward enquiry.<p>                You  know  Nick  Higham  -  the             chap  who  covers  media   stories             on the telly  news?    I  want  to             send a fax to  him.    What's  the             best number to dial into?<p>             You   would   not   believe    the             rigmarole it took to extract  this             apparently         straightforward             information        from        the             switchboard    operator    banging             furiously   away   on   some    no             doubt  damn   digital-information-             obscurity-maximising   system   in             front of her.  It  was  completely             pathetic.  Try  it  for  yourself.<p>              <b>Same question, different name</b>. <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
