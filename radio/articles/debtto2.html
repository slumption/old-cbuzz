I want to  stress  again             that  I  am  not  advocating  that             people set up pirate  stations  or             encouraging them to do  so.    But             they will anyway, whatever I say or             do, particularly when there is such             a  glaring  mismatch  between  the             demand for spectrum and the  legal             supply of it.<p>             The case against piracy was put in             a big public campaign by RTE,  the             Irish state broadcaster, in 1984, in             the middle of  a  enormous  battle             between  them   and   well-muscled             pirate operations.  If you want to             read the whole fascinating story of             what  happened  in  Ireland   when             things got really out of hand, I can             strongly   recommend   the    book             'Radio Radio',  by  Peter  Mulryan             (Borderline    Publications,    38             Clarendon St, DUBLIN 2   ISBN  no.             1 870300 03 3).<p>             The  RTE   campaign   listed   the             following points:<p>             (i) it undermines respect for  the             law;<p>             (ii) it puts emergency services at             risk;<p>             (iii) it interferes with air traffic             control;<p>             (iv) it has  no  legal  or  social             responsibility;<p>             (v)  it  interferes   with   legal             broadcasting;<p>             (vi) it interferes with legitimate             enjoyment of radio and television;<p>             (vii) it  puts  jobs  at  risk  in             newspapers and broadcasting;<p>             (viii) it steals from the work  of             musicians, singers and journalists;<p>                   <b> Respect for the law</b><p>             The first point - respect for the law             - is important.  It is not in anyone's             interests for complete anarchy  to             prevail, as it did at various points in             Irish broadcasting history.  At one             point  a  certain   operator   was             deliberately using up  frequencies             with multiple simulcasts simply to             prevent others doing so.  The weak             were flattened by the  strong  and             there was no-one to defend them.<p>             This is what - in my naivety - I think             the business of regulation should be             about.  It should be protecting the             weak  against  the  powerful   and             greedy because if it is not seen as             doing so, how can it expect to gain             respect among ordinary people?<p>             The spectrum does  not  belong  to             the   Government,   nor   was   it             invented by the DTI.  It is a natural             resource, like the sun and the rain,             and  it  will  work  for   anyone,             anywhere, any time.    If  someone             wants to use spectrum in a socially-             constructive way,  then  it  would             seem to me to be a basic principle             of justice that the less you want,             the easier it should be to get it.<p>             However, the less  you  want,  the             less important you must be, and the             less likely you are to have friends in             high places.  If you  want  3  MHz             nationwide  and   your   name   is             Richard Branson you will be  taken             seriously.  If you want ten watts to             cover a campus, go to the back  of             the queue...<p>             If you can sustain  a  student  or             hospital station on voluntary effort             and   5,000  a  year,  and  run  a             service commercially on paid effort             and  500,000 a year,  why  is  the             prospect  of  a  semi-professional             station running on  50,000 a  year             thought  to  be  such  an   absurd             proposal?  Virtually no  provision             exists  in  the  UK  for  services             functioning at around this sort of             scale  from,   say,   hundred-watt             transmitters.  No wonder there are so many pirates! <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
