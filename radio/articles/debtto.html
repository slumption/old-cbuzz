I  first  met  this             gentleman only five years ago at a             station   with   the   same   name             operating in our area, er, without             the benefit of a licence.  I'm glad he             didn't get caught.  So is he.<p>             Good luck, Eugene.    I  hope  you             make lots of money and continue to             impress us with your sharp clothes             sense.  But will you remember your             roots?  When the pirate  scene  in             Manchester starts chipping away at             your audience by being more street-             credible than you are, will you (a)             give the best pirate DJ's a job (b)             go even more  mainstream  for  the             family audience or (c) get on  the             'phone to the DTI urging that these             outlaws be busted?<p>             I met some  local  pirates  a  few             months ago and their first question             was -  what  was  my  attitude  to             pirate radio?  I said that responsible             piracy  (clean  signal,   suitable             frequency) was a form of  pressure             on    the    authorities     which             strengthens  the  case   for   new             stations,    simpler     licensing             procedures,      and      low-cost             opportunities for legal broadcasting.<p>             Pirate  broadcasting   proves   by             demonstration a point which I have             taken   twenty   years   and   two             nervous breakdowns  to  get  over:             that you do not  need  to  be  Mr.             Moneybags to start a  broadcasting             service,  and   that   there   are             thousands of people waiting in any             area who are  totally  unimpressed             with what they get from  radio  at             the moment, but can be fired  with             enthusiasm for something which  is             in tune  with  their  musical  and             cultural needs, especially when they             go well  beyond  Whitney  Houston,             Phil Collins, and all the other well-             worn stuff  that  comes  from  the             usual school of radio formatting.             I would not  encourage  anyone  to             pirate: it's very difficult to do a             good  job  of  broadcasting   when             you're watching your back all  the             time, and the penalties are serious,             including that nasty ban on working             legally for five years after you get             caught.<p>             This  is  a  perverse   provision:             intended as a deterrent to illegal             broadcasting,   it    must    have             completely  the  opposite   effect             when it comes into force.  Banning             someone  who  is  obviously   daft             about radio  from  pursuing  their             career legally  leaves  them  with             nothing to lose by continuing their             pirate activities.  And a five-year             sentence seems a heavy penalty for             a crime with no victim.  Set against             some of the things  you  could  be             fined  2000 for, starting a  radio             station seems positively benevolent.<p>             <b>Moreover:</b><p>             (a)   radio   listening   is   not             compulsory, and if the station has             been  properly  engineered  no-one             will lose a service, but some people             will gain one for a while...<p>             (b) there  should  be  more,  many             more opportunities for  people  to             enter  the  profession  of   radio             broadcasting with little experience             or  money  behind  them.      Many             people now with  regular  jobs  in             commercial radio cut their teeth on             pirate stations  of  one  sort  or             another, landbased or offshore.  It             ill becomes the radio Establishment             to get sanctimonious about the law             when their industry is riddled with             people who have at  one  point  or             another broken it, some  in  quite             spectacular fashion...<p>             (c) When I  ring up pirates and tell             them if their signal is likely to cause             problems -  over-deviation  or  an             unsuitable  choice  of   frequency             being the  most  common  faults  -             most are very receptive to this sort             of input, and would probably  make             responsible  operators  given  the             chance... <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
