I             have  a  need  for  such  a  thing             myself: soon I am supposed  to  be             starting to hold evening classes in             such  matters,  and  it  would  be             useful to be able to point students             in the direction of further reading             matter once  they've  digested  my             notes.<p>             The first thing  I  would  say  to             anyone wanting to learn more about             technicalities is - don't be afraid to             ask your station engineer questions.             While it is possible to be a perfectly             good   presenter   or    programme             controller without  any  technical             knowledge, anyone who  aspires  to             a career further up the ladder will             be seriously handicapped  if  they             don't know what people are talking             about when it comes to technology.<p>             There are of course two aspects to             the technical  question,  both  of             which I try to tackle in these pages.             There are the nitty-gritty technical             details of  how  things  work  and             what might  go  wrong  with  them,             and then  there  are  the  broader             issues  around  new  technology  -             digital radio, automated  studios,             satellite services and so on.  What             is the value and  impact  of  such             developments?  What technology  is             most appropriate for what  we  are             trying to do?  Which systems do we             want and which are of  no  use  to             us?    How  will  new   technology             affect the radio industry?<p>             I learnt what little I know first from             reading magazines  like  Practical             Wireless and Practical Electronics             when I was at school in the sixties.             And, of  course,  by  taking  gear             apart and generally fiddling about             with  it.    Although  both  these             magazine titles still exist, Practical             Wireless is exclusively now a radio             ham's    magazine,    and     most             electronics     magazines     have             precious little about broadcast radio             in them.<p>             So any tips to help  readers  like             Tony would be  appreciated.    One             day I will write the book myself, but             in the meantime -  ask  questions,             and hopefully you  will  get  some             answers which make sense  to  you.             Don't be afraid to stop an engineer             in mid-flow if he uses a  term  or             expression you  are  not  familiar             with.    There  is  no  shame   in             ignorance, only in letting it lie.<p>             If anyone wants to suggest a topic             or question for discussion in these             pages,    please  e-mail   me   at             normac@fastnet.co.uk.<p><b><center>                       News in Brief</center></b><p>             The  latest  edition  of  the  CRA             journal AirFlash is expected out at             the end of  March.    It  contains             features  on  the  Labour  Party's             policy on broadcasting  (I  didn't             know they had one), an analysis of             the  failure  of  an  Asian-backed             group to obtain a Bradford licence             and the way they were  treated  by             the Radio Authority, and, I'm told, a             piece  by   some   Norman   McLeod             (who he?) on the 105 - 108 saga.<p>             Messrs.   Alice   Soundtech   have             contingency plans to rewrite their             advertisement which appears on the             front page of this journal.  See the             bit at the bottom about 'over  300             new broadcasting licences..'  Will it             soon read 'nearly half-a-dozen new             broadcasting licences...' if certain             parties have their way? <p>             Any readers wishing to comment  on             what I have said  are  welcome  to             call me on 01 273 684 172 or  send             e-mail to <a href=mailto:normac@fastnet.co.uk> normac@fastnet.co.uk</a><P>             Copyright NJ McLeod 1995<BR> <P><HR><a HREF=index.html>Back to the cBuzz Radio - Articles page</a><HR></BODY></HTML>
