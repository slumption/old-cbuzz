We are proud to present the first of these interviews which was held in Cyberia in the past week - making it one of the quickest questionnaires to hit the public realm. The target, a personal favourite, is the author <b>Douglas Rushkoff</b>. He wrote the book <b>Cyberia - Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace</b>, which attempts to define how the Internet is as it is and how so-called slackers are the lifeblood of the system. His next book is called <b>Media Virus!</b> and should be published this year (1995).<p>
